{"article": [{"title": "5 charts that explain inflation, wages, supply chains and restaurants - The Washington Post", "author": "Alyssa Fowers", "date": "9:56 a.m. EDT", "body": "Twenty-one months after the country’s first confirmed case of the coronavirus, the U.S. economy remains rocked by conflicting forces, with businesses and households struggling to adjust to what many hoped would be a temporary disruption. Uncertainty obscures the path forward. Backlogged supply chains have left ships — and the imports they carry — stuck outside key U.S. ports. Inflation has driven up the cost of everyday items and prices aren’t easing. Restaurant reservations have seesawed for months, bobbing up and down as Americans consider whether they feel safe amid the ongoing pandemic. Meanwhile, the labor market has whipsawed millions of Americans through layoffs and then rehirings, with millions  caught  in between. Wages are up, and people are switching jobs at a record rate. And while growth for the year is still projected to approach 6 percent, White House and Federal Reserve officials underestimated the economic disruption that would persist through the pandemic’s second year. Now it appears certain that many of these strains, both economic and viral, will continue well into 2022, and perhaps beyond. The real reason inflation is becoming so worrisome: It’s getting in our heads “There’s just no road map to opening a global economy in a pandemic, and people keep forgetting we’re still in a pandemic,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. Now the recovery not only has to fix what was lost, but also the “scars and wounds have to heal” after hard-hit workers and industries reevaluated their futures, Swonk said. Swonk pointed to actor William Shatner, who blasted into space several days ago, and drew a comparison to what’s unfolding in the economy: “We’re seeing some friction upon reentry.” Here’s a breakdown of what’s happening in the economy, in 5 charts. As many companies tried to reopen rapidly, they complained that it was difficult to find workers who were willing to accept the same pay and conditions that had been offered pre-pandemic. So a number of companies hiked wages to try to lure workers away from other jobs. This pushed up income, especially for workers who are willing to jump ship for a new employer. Workers who switch jobs almost always earn larger raises than those who stick at the same employer, but that gap has opened to the widest point in more than two decades. Job switchers got a typical hourly raise of about 5.4 percent from a year earlier, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s wage tracker, which analyzes Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Rising wages can be a good thing, giving workers more money to spend to help the economy grow. But economists worry about the ripple effects of rising wages at the same time that companies are struggling to fill more than 10 million empty jobs. If employers hike wages to attract workers, they may in turn have to pass those higher labor costs on to consumers in the form of higher prices. That could send inflation even higher. For months, officials at the Fed and White House have argued that inflation is a “transitory,” or temporary, feature of the economic recovery, like an old car lurching into gear. The expectation from many top Washington economic officials  is that once supply chains have time to clear their backlogs, inflation will settle down closer to the Fed’s 2 percent annual target, sometime next year. But that message is becoming increasingly hard to defend. “Temporary” has lasted for months, and it will last for months more. The September consumer price index shows annual price growth came in at or above 5 percent for the fifth consecutive month. Plus, last month’s rising food and shelter costs together contributed to more than half of the monthly increase of all items, when seasonally adjusted, making it harder for people to afford everyday expenses. Wages are rising, but that increase is getting eaten up by higher costs. Inflation in the economy today is different. Here are four charts that can explain why. Throughout the pandemic, new and used cars have been a litmus test for the country’s supply chain issues and related price hikes. The market relies heavily on trade-ins and auto parts, which are in low supply amid a global microchip shortage. Used cars and trucks have driven a surge in inflation this year and are up a whopping 52 percent since September 2019. But the Fed and the White House don’t only have to control inflation. They also have to control the way they talk about it. Consumers may be watching the signals Washington’s leaders send about whether higher prices are sticking around. One Fed official is ditching the word “transitory” altogether, saying it gives the public a false expectation that high prices will cool in a short time frame. “It’s not just the time, it’s whether this is becoming a little more embedded in the underlying inflation trends. That’s what we were thinking in terms of ‘transitory,’” said Tim Duy, an economist and Fed expert at the University of Oregon. “And increasingly, I would say it looks like it appears that the price pressures are more widespread, and as a result, more likely to result in elevated underlying inflation going forward.” Restaurants’ bottom lines have recovered with surprising speed in recent months. Data released by the Census Bureau on Friday shows restaurant sales topped $72 billion in August — about in line with the level that would have been expected had the pandemic never happened. But employment in the sector in September remained about a million jobs below its prerecession levels, even as employers posted a near-record number of job openings — 1.5 million in August alone. And the recovery has been uneven. Some restaurants are doing much better than others. The disconnect is likely related to the pandemic, as high levels of covid-19 cases appear to be related to falling restaurant employment. In Detroit, Nya Marshall remembers when the delta variant came “knocking at everyone’s door” over the summer. Going into the fall, Marshall is running her restaurant, Ivy Kitchen, with reduced hours and shifts. She said that workers did not rush back on the payrolls when unemployment benefits expired and that many are leaving the industry altogether, especially while child care is a pressing concern. Business is still down 52 percent compared with pre-covid levels. And Marshall knows she’s not alone. “Delta is here, and there is a misconception that the restaurants have recovered, that we’re back to where we were,” Marshall said. “People are not comfortable coming out. And if they do, we’re fortunate the patio is still open. But patio season is ending soon.” Why all that inflation? Prices for used cars and other import-reliant items have risen rapidly as covid-19 wreaked havoc on global supply chains that were already stretched thin by Americans’ prolonged pandemic-era goods-buying binge. Many of the goods that are successfully offloaded from ships end up stranded in U.S. ports as trucking companies struggle to hire and rail yards suffer their own backlogs. Before the pandemic, container ships would usually sail directly from China to a berth at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. But since the first pandemic winter, more and more container ships have needed to wait in San Pedro Bay for a chance to dock and unload their cargo, peaking at 40 ships in February. Coronavirus cases dropped in the spring, and the backlog of ships started to go down. As the delta variant emerged in the United States, though, the number of waiting ships spiked alongside coronavirus cases. More than 70 ships waited offshore on Sept. 19. Meanwhile, cargo languishes on container ships. Delays in getting cargo off container ships are passed on through the supply chain. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell told lawmakers last month that the supply-side constraints on the economy have, “in some cases, gotten worse,” adding that “we need those supply blockages to alleviate, to abate before inflation can come down.” The Biden administration several days ago announced a 24/7 operation at a key U.S. port and is working with major importers to clear a path for cargo ahead of the holiday season. Companies like Walmart, FedEx and UPS have also committed to using the extended hours at the Port of Los Angeles to offload shipping containers contributing to the freight backlog. Pulling off a round-the-clock effort will depend on cooperation with foreign-owned shipping companies and operators across the transportation sphere, said Frank Ponce De Leon, the International Longshore and Warehouse Union’s Coast Committeeman for the Coast Longshore Division. “This problem is not going to disappear in one day, in one month. It’s going to be a continued problem for a while now,” Ponce De Leon  said. “There are things that can change … not only on the docks, but for the trucking industry, for the warehousing industry, the railroad industry. We can’t move cargo without those three parts of the puzzles.” Laura Reiley and David J. Lynch contributed to this report.

"Hannah Dreier", "date": "9:00 a.m. EDT", "body": "CHICO, Calif. — Mike Erickson had been living in the trailer park for 341 days when he saw the new sign. It was unmissable, a blue billboard at the entrance to what had become a place of last resort for families made homeless by the worst wildfire in California history. Its message was unmissable, too. In 12 days, the site would be closing and everyone would have to be out. Mike knew who had put it there. The same agency that had carved this trailer park from nothing after the 2018 fire, transforming a 13-acre field between a cemetery and a set of train tracks into a haven for survivors to start rebuilding their lives: the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Nearly a hundred families lived at the site at one point, but one by one they had been moving away until on this day in September only a handful were left. Mike’s trailer was at the farthest end. There were no streets here and no addresses, just small numbers glued to the sides of trailers. His was 83. He trudged back through the gravel, wondering what to tell his wife. “I thought by now we’d have something figured out,” he said. Sixty years old, Mike had arrived at this moment because of a  FEMA program intended to be among its most merciful, but which has become fraught with challenges in a time when whole communities are being wiped out by unprecedented wildfires and storms. When survivors are left with nowhere to go, the government sends FEMA to give them free housing, typically for up to 18 months after the date of the disaster. The agency has provided emergency trailers to nearly 200,000 families over the past 15 years. But now, with disasters and the needs that follow them increasing, the government finds itself trying to decide what it owes the displaced. How long is truly long enough to shelter the most vulnerable? Is it sufficient to give them housing or do they need social services, too? And should an emergency management agency really be playing landlord for years at a time in the first place? For Mike, the looming question was more urgent: What would happen after these 12 days? Inside the trailer, his wife, Crystal Erickson, 60, was lying in a hospital bed that took up most of the small living room. Partially paralyzed from a stroke and unable to navigate through the gravel with her wheelchair, this is where she spent all her time. “What’s up, honey?” she asked. “FEMA came by. Same thing as always,” he said, trying to sound relaxed. But after 35 years together, she knew when something was wrong. Mike took her hand, patted it and let go. “Just trust me,” he said. * * * Mike and Crystal were in this park because their home had been destroyed by the kind of wildfire that was once unheard of in the United States but that now, after so many others — the Dixie Fire, the Caldor Fire — seems almost routine. Known as the Camp Fire, it had started before dawn in November  2018,  raced through terrain made tinder-dry by drought, burned down almost every house in the mountain town of Paradise, and killed 85 people and displaced 50,000, including Mike and Crystal. They were among the last to evacuate and had driven through thick black smoke listening to the pop of propane tanks exploding. Afterward, FEMA had to decide what to do with the people like the Ericksons had just become — survivors without insurance, without means, who had never been homeless before but were now. It wasn’t clear at first that the government would build a trailer park. FEMA had turned away from those after the Hurricane Katrina recovery effort, when families lingered in flimsy, formaldehyde-tainted mobile homes. The agency experimented instead with making emergency repairs directly to survivors’ homes. It also partnered with the Department of Housing and Urban Development to give families rental subsidies and mandatory case management to connect them with social services. By 2013, the FEMA trailer park had gone almost extinct. But under the Trump administration, the agency returned to building entire communities of trailers from scratch, saying the alternatives were costly and inefficient. The Government Accountability Office later found it was impossible to evaluate this claim because FEMA doesn’t systematically track costs or outcomes for its housing programs. The national council set up by Congress to advise the agency immediately called on FEMA to resurrect its direct repair program, and elected leaders from hard-hit states asked FEMA to bring back its HUD partnership. But FEMA continued to see trailer parks as the best option, at least for the time being, explaining in a statement: “FEMA is evolving. We are not the same agency from 10 years ago, and we will not be the same agency in 10 years from now.” As a result, thousands of families were soon living in trailers again, including at the Chico site, which cost more than $300,000 per trailer to set up. Mike and Crystal moved there in September 2020. Before that, Crystal had spent six months in the hospital, while Mike had bounced between motels and campsites. They also lived temporarily at a different FEMA site. But Trailer 83 seemed to offer a kind of stability they hadn’t experienced since before the fire. The place came with rules, one of which said tenants had to submit proof every fifteen days that they had applied for at least one permanent housing option. Every fifteen days, Mike turned that in, along with the results: nothing. Rental vacancies had fallen to less than half of 1 percent in Chico as 20,000 fire survivors crammed into a city of 90,000. Mike wrote personal letters to landlords of wheelchair-accessible apartments but didn’t hear back. When he went to sign up for affordable housing, he learned that the waiting list was three years long and closed to new applicants. Now, with 11 days left before the deadline to move out, Mike flipped through a notebook where he’d written down the names and numbers of every official he had spoken with since the fire. As he began making calls, he fidgeted with his hair, which he used to wear in a buzz-cut but had grown out into tangled curls. The first person he reached was a young woman at a social services agency. He told her about who he had once been: a man who had coached his son’s Little League team, held a steady job, owned a home and had lost that home in 2016, buried in medical debt after his wife’s stroke. He said they moved to a rental with their 18-year-old son, who helped care for Crystal while he worked. He explained their son had initially moved to Trailer 83, too, but FEMA had said he couldn’t stay because he wasn’t on his parents’ paperwork, and that with no one to help Crystal during the day, Mike couldn’t work, and so they were living on her disability payments of $2,800 a month — $1,799.31 of which FEMA was now billing them for because a few months earlier, overwhelmed, he had missed turning in proof of his fruitless rental searches. By the time he got around to telling the woman that they were about to be evicted, she was letting him know that she couldn’t help. “We don’t really have room for new cases,” she said, but offered to connect him with another nonprofit. “Okay, I sure appreciate it. Thank you,” Mike said. After a while, Crystal fell asleep and Mike slipped out for a walk. There was no greenery at the site, no shade, and no color aside from the green trash bins outside each home. He walked past Trailer 46, where a small woman who liked to keep to herself peeked through the blinds. Past Trailer 11, where a father, preparing to move out, was trying to scrape off the glow-in-the-dark stars he’d put up for his kids. Past Trailer 7, where a FEMA eviction notice fluttered on the door, warning, “We have not been able to contact you by telephone and must speak with you right away.” Mike knew that the man who lived inside had a hole in his trachea and couldn’t talk. When he reached Trailer 32, a snarling German shepherd ran at him. The dog had bitten him twice, but Mike liked visiting with its owner, Jay Rose, who was stacking boxes in the truck he used for his job hauling portable toilets. “You mind if I ask if you found a place to go?” Mike asked. “No, just putting stuff in storage,” Jay said. “I’m gonna be the last one in here.” Mike told Jay about his efforts to find a place. “I’m so fried now, it’s hard to even make contact,” he said. He didn’t want to stay too long. He’d left his phone charging and worried about missing a call from someone with a lead. He hurried back, climbed the steps and checked his phone in his bedroom. No calls. * * * Mornings in the trailer often started the same way: With Crystal hearing tires rolling on gravel and Mike looking out to see if it was FEMA. With nine days to go, Crystal heard that crunch as Mike was making coffee and braced herself, but it was only a garbage truck. “I’m surprised they’re still taking the trash away,” Mike said, and dropped the curtain. But there was someone from FEMA there, on the other side of the park. Housing task force leader Sharon Rodarte had come to check on the last tenants. These were always the hardest cases — the families who left behind wrecked appliances, or walls full of holes, or towering piles of junk and trash, or in one case a dead dog. “Some people aren’t grateful,” she said when she walked up to Trailer 7 and discovered that the man who couldn’t speak had moved away overnight, leaving behind a broken pipe that was gushing water beneath the unit. Now she headed toward Trailer 83. Crystal heard the crush of tires and a knock at the door. Rodarte explained that she was there because she had a phone number for the Ericksons to call — “our housing navigator for trying to find homes for people who are going to be homeless.” Mike grabbed his notebook and stepped outside, closing the door behind him. He had written the word “deficient” in it, and he looked down and read from the page. “You know this place is deficient for us,” he said. “Okay, I don’t want to get into this,” Rodarte said. But Mike was off now, listing the things that had made life so difficult in the trailer. No roll-in shower. No way to cool the place below 78 degrees. No washer or dryer, even though it wasn’t safe to leave Crystal alone to go to a laundromat, which was why there were five garbage bags of laundry sitting by the door. “I’m gonna go,” Rodarte said. “Just give the man a call.” “Okay, just walk away,” Mike called after her. “Thank you for being so courteous and respectful.” Back inside, Mike regretted getting mad. “I’m exploding over nothing lately,” he told Crystal, who instantly blamed herself. She had been more emotional since the stroke, cycling through feelings of calm, fear, anger, grief, and now another emotion took hold, this time making her cry. “I’m sorry, honey. I’m so sorry,” she said. “It’s not your fault, you know that. You didn’t start that fire,” Mike said. He turned on the television for her and gave her a sippy cup, the kind a child might use, with two shots of brandy. When he called the housing navigator, he got an automated message saying that the phone system was down. Mike hung up and looked out across the park. He wondered, how have so many people figured this out? That evening, there was another knock at the door. This time it was their daughter, Rita. She’d lost her home in the fire, too, and, like their son, was barred from the extra trailer bedroom. She lived a few blocks away, in a tent under an oak tree. Paradise fire survivors make up about a third of Chico’s growing homeless population, and many had moved into the 100-person encampment where Rita was staying. Rita didn’t talk about all that went on there, like the man who had been stabbed to death in a fight a few weeks earlier as she watched with horror, prompting her to start carrying a hunting knife in her bra and another in her backpack. When she walked in, Crystal’s mood changed again. “Give me a kiss,” she called.  * * * There were tasks Rita did almost immediately whenever she visited. She combed Crystal’s hair, trimmed her fingernails, gave her sponge baths. Mike did everything else. He checked Crystal’s blood sugar five times a day. He made her meals and helped feed her. He put fresh bandages on the bedsores she’d been developing. And sometimes he left her alone, as he did one morning with seven days left before the deadline. He tried to get out every day to clear his head, even if it was just to hit a few golf balls and watch them skip across the gravel. Before he left, Crystal asked him to straighten her in bed so she could breathe better. “I think I’m a little cockeyed today,” she said. “You’ve been cockeyed for years,” he said, teasing. Some things Crystal only let herself think about when she was alone, like how badly she’d deteriorated since the fire. After her stroke, she had still been able to sit up on her own. But with no physical therapy in more than two years, she’d grown weak and rigid. The only person who had come out was a nurse who monitored her blood-thinning medication for a while, then said she had to stop because the gravel was damaging her car. Crystal had worked in nursing homes, and made Mike promise that he would never put her in one. It was an easy promise for Mike to keep. He’d grown up with distant parents — an alcoholic father and a strict mother — and had wanted his own family to be close and loving. But people with disabilities are often unnecessarily institutionalized after natural disasters, especially if they are poor, according to a 2019 report from the National Council on Disability. Crystal didn’t think she could avoid long-term care much longer. Lately, she was sleeping with the overhead light on because of a dream she’d been having in which she had been sent to hell for being a burden on her family. When Mike got back from the store, she told him about how she was longing to see trees and grass. “I feel stupid for wanting that,” she said. “It’s not stupid,” Mike said, and proposed they at least go out to the porch. It was a 10-minute process to get her out of bed by himself. He rolled her back and forth to get her into a net, which he then attached to a lifting machine. He began pumping a lever to lift the net into the air. When Crystal was suspended, he maneuvered her toward a wheelchair, and then hit the lever again to lower her until she could sit. Outside, the air was dry and full of ash from two wildfires burning nearby. Minutes passed. She was smiling. Then she looked uncertain. Then she was in pain from her bedsores and started crying. Then she was calling out for Mike, who had gone inside to do the dishes. He rushed her back in and hoisted her in the net as her crying turned to screaming. “Oh God, just do it,” she screamed, suspended now above the bed. But Mike was afraid of letting her fall and was so focused that he didn’t hear the crunch of approaching cars. It wasn’t until someone was knocking that he looked out and saw two FEMA security guards and two women who were strangers. “Give me a minute,” he yelled. But the knocking got louder and so Mike paused and threw the door open, revealing Crystal suspended in the net, clothed in only a T-shirt. “You might as well get a front-row seat,” Mike said to the group. The guards looked aghast and took a step back. “You want to know why we haven’t gotten out of here? I’m doing this all day long.” Mike slammed the door. “You’re doing good,” he said to Crystal as he lowered her into bed and pulled up her sheet. When he opened the door again, the guards had retreated to their cars and only the two women remained. They said they were from a disaster case management program and wanted to help Mike apply for a subsidized apartment. “FEMA just reached out to us, with the site closing in a week,” one of the women said. “We’re here to support you.” Mike felt a flood of relief. He invited them in, apologizing. “Please do not apologize,” the woman said. “My heart is feeling for you right now.” She helped Mike fill out an application and said she would get them signed up for food stamps, too. She suggested the Ericksons might be able to buy their trailer and move it somewhere permanent, because FEMA generally auctions them off at the end of housing programs, with bids sometimes starting at a few hundred dollars. Another mood shift for Crystal, as she thought of a trailer park near her son and how nice it would be to see him more often. The sense of hope the women brought with them carried over into the next day, and the day after, five days to go now, as the Ericksons waited to hear about the housing application and another stranger arrived at their door. Word had started spreading among Paradise survivors about their case. The visitor said he’d heard that Crystal lived in a hospital bed and couldn’t even shower. He had come over on his own with a large rubber tub for her. He and Mike wrestled the tub inside, moving bags of laundry to make it fit. Soon, the trailer was filled with steam from hot water and the comforting smell of bath soap. “Oh, that feels good,” Crystal said after Mike had put her in the net and maneuvered her into the tub. She waved her arms beneath the surface of the water, transfixed. She could feel her hands and legs unclenching. She started splashing. “Do I get to stay here forever? Till they move us out?” she asked. Mike smiled. “Soak as long as you want,” he said. They went to bed feeling better than they had in 349 nights. And then came the next day, four days left, when the good feeling began to drain away. * * * How is hope dashed? In three conversations. First, the women came back and explained that the Ericksons couldn’t buy their trailer because FEMA wasn’t selling them to survivors who had failed to provide regular proof of rental searches. Then, another case manager stopped by and told them that they hadn’t qualified for the apartment. Their income was too low. And there was nothing else to apply for. “Trust me — we have looked everywhere, in every town. We are in a housing crisis in this county and we have literally tried everything,” she said. And then a FEMA supervisor called to say that if the Ericksons were not out by the deadline, they would be trespassing and he would call the police. “I’m sorry about it, but that’s the way it goes,” he said. “We’re at the end of the game. It’s really in your best interests to move on.” Mike felt his temper rising, but spoke softly so Crystal would not hear. “We’d love to move on,” he said. “We’re not here because we love to be here. You know that, right?” “Well, we have done everything we can under federal law, as FEMA, to help you out,” the supervisor said. Two days left to go now, and FEMA workers were showing up to collect keys from the remaining tenants, including Jay Rose, the man who had predicted he would be the last one left in the park. The inspector who completed his walk-through waited with her finger on the circuit breaker until he microwaved a last frozen breakfast sandwich. “Good luck,” she said as she flipped off the power. He had 10 days paid at a motel, and then would be sleeping in his truck. Away went Jay. Away went his snarling dog. Away went everyone else, and by that evening, the only trailer left in the park with anyone still home was the one where Crystal was in her hospital bed and Mike was on the porch when a truck pulled up. The man who got out had dozens of colorful tattoos over his arms and legs, and he handed Mike a business card that said “Stephen Murray: Camp Fire Survivor/Supporter.” He explained that he had helped others facing eviction from FEMA parks and had heard from a friend of a friend that the Ericksons were about to be put on the street. “I’m going to at least try to get you in a hotel for a few nights,” he said before he left.  What an unbelievable place this is, Mike thought as he leaned with his elbows on the porch railing. Created out of nothing. About to be nothing again. And his last version of hope coming down to a man who had the slogan “Stephen Murray Spreading Love” tattooed on his biceps and etched into a rubber bracelet, which he had slipped off his wrist and onto Crystal’s. For three years now, it had been one strange and heart-rending thing after another, going back to those first weeks after the fire when Mike was living at a campground and had seen people clutching blankets and struggling to speak coherently. “I used to look down on them and think, ‘Can’t you pull yourself out of that?’ But now I can’t pull myself out of it, either,” he said. Mike needed to go in and check on Crystal, but he kept staring at the moon, which was glowing red through the fire smog. “I don’t condemn them anymore,” he said. “I didn’t understand how far you can go down, I guess.”  * * * One day left now, and when Mike woke up, he was struck by how quiet the park had become. In that silence, his phone rang. “Finding a handicap hotel room in California is hard,” Stephen said. “But I’ve got one.” And just like that, the Ericksons had a place lined up. It would be for a week. Stephen said he would pay for it. He had also rented a storage unit and would send someone for the hospital bed. “Thank you,” Mike said, and then told Crystal that they had a place to go. “It’s got sidewalks, right?” she asked. “Yes,” Mike said. She tried to picture it. “I’m so excited to get out of here,” she said. Mike had some boxes saved, and he started taping them together. He didn’t need many. There wasn’t much to pack, mostly donated clothes and kitchen supplies. “You’re always so organized,” Crystal said, watching Mike fold up her blankets. “Not this time,” he said. He taped together a new box and tossed in a pair of pliers that were among the only things they’d saved from the fire, a self-help book about managing stress and the notebook with his FEMA information. It didn’t take long. An hour and 14 small boxes. Now that they had a destination, Mike arranged for a paratransit bus to come. He rolled the lifting machine through the trailer for a last time, swung Crystal in the net and lowered her in the wheelchair. A few more minutes and he had the bed stripped and disassembled. Nothing more to do but sit and wait. “Way too quiet in here,” Mike said, and unpacked the radio so he could listen to music. At last, there was the sound of tires on gravel, and a friend of Stephen’s took the boxes and the bed. Another rumble and the bus arrived. Mike followed Crystal down the ramp, leaving the trailer door open. He helped strap her in and paid their fare. As the bus began rolling away, Mike looked out the window, taking everything in one last time, while Crystal squeezed her eyes shut. “I don’t want to look around. I can’t stand this place,” she said. Mike was remembering the early days when they first moved in, before their son left. “The kids not being able to stay with us, that just tore our family apart,” he said. As they approached the entrance, Crystal glanced back at the lot. “I liked it better when there were all those trailers,” she said. “It made a great driving range to hit the golf balls,” Mike said, and with that, the bus passed through the fence and turned right, and the Ericksons were gone, except for a few things they had left behind. A lawn chair, a fan, a mirror, a mop. All of it noted by a FEMA inspector who came later that day. “Okey-doke,” he said. “I’ve seen a lot worse.” The deadbolt didn’t work, so he pulled the front door shut and pronounced it good enough. “We’re finished,” he said, and hours later, as night settled in, Trailer 83 was a shadow in a dark corner of an empty lot. There was nothing to break the silence as midnight came and then went and the park was officially closed. The housing program was over. FEMA had fulfilled its obligations to the displaced. At the motel across town, Crystal was asleep and Mike, who had been so excited when they arrived that he jumped into the pool with a whoop, lay awake in bed. They’d ordered pizza and watched a movie, and when they got tired, Crystal had asked Mike to leave the overhead lights on. Now, as she slept, he stared up at them, thinking that they couldn’t afford to stay beyond the week Stephen had booked. They would need to find somewhere to go. He had six days left to figure it out.", "preprocessed": "chico  calif  mike erickson live trailer park 341 day saw new sign  it unmiss  blue billboard entranc becom place last resort famili make

"Peter Whoriskey", "date": "10:00 p.m. EDT", "body": "The Denver Art Museum is preparing to return four antiquities to Cambodia following a news media collaboration that reported the pieces are linked to a man charged with trafficking looted artifacts. The four antiquities to be returned came to the museum through Douglas Latchford, who in 2019 was indicted by U.S. prosecutors after decades of alleged trafficking in looted artifacts from the Khmer Empire, which flourished in Southeast Asia a thousand years ago. The Washington Post, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and other news organizations in the Pandora Papers collaboration began contacting museum officials about pieces in their collection linked to Latchford in June and followed up with a letter in September. The museum removed the four artifacts from its collection after receiving the letter from the news organizations seeking comment about the items. Global hunt for looted treasures leads to offshore trusts “The museum is now working with the government to return the pieces to Cambodia,” museum spokesperson Kristy Bassuener said in an email. The media collaboration reported that 10 museums around the world held at least 43 relics that passed through the hands of Latchford or those of his associates identified by prosecutors. The four relics from Denver are of “extraordinary cultural significance,” said Bradley J. Gordon, one of the lawyers representing the Cambodian Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts. Gordon is part of a team the ministry assembled to track down pieces looted from Cambodia during the decades of tumult around a civil war and the genocidal regime of Pol Pot. While the Cambodian officials said they welcomed the Denver announcement, the protracted negotiations over the four pieces reflect the general reluctance of museums to return Khmer artifacts that Cambodian officials assert were stolen from the country. As far back as nine years ago, the Latchford pieces at the Denver museum were highlighted by a blog devoted to looted antiquities. Latchford had not been indicted at that point, but the blog, Chasing Aphrodite, noted that prosecutors had linked him to other allegedly looted pieces. Key findings from the Pandora Papers investigation After Latchford was indicted in 2019, officials with the Denver Art Museum contacted Cambodian officials about the four pieces but, according to Gordon, the museum “did not agree” to return them. Cambodian officials also requested ownership records for all of the museum’s Khmer Empire relics. “To date, we received no response to our request for these records,” Gordon said. The decision by the Denver museum was earlier reported by the Colorado Sun, and that is where Cambodian officials learned of the announcement, Gordon said. One of the four relics to be returned — a prehistoric bell — likely belongs to a set of 12 that had been looted from a province north of the capital, Phnom Penh, experts say. According to the Cambodian team’s research, Latchford likely owned at least half of the stolen set, Gordon said. “When you put them together, they made different sounds, and it is believed that they were used to call warriors to battle,” said Gordon. “Now they are spread around the world, which means it’s impossible for musicologists to study them.” Another one of the relics to be returned is a sandstone Prajnaparamita, the goddess of transcendent wisdom — one of the antiquities named in the Pandora Papers investigation. According to a 2019 indictment, Latchford gave the museum documents with conflicting ownership history at the time of the relic’s acquisition in 2000. One document stated that Latchford had purchased the piece from a man identified in the indictment as the “false collector.” Another document showed that Latchford had been in possession of the relic five years earlier. Foreign money secretly floods U.S. tax havens. Some of it is tainted. According to an archived page on the museum’s website, the Prajnaparamita had been purchased in honor of the late Emma C. Bunker, a scholar who co-authored three books with Latchford. The two other relics that will be returned include a sun god and a lintel with carvings of the Hindu gods Vishnu and Brahma. Both relics were published in one of Latchford’s books — a technique that prosecutors said he used to give looted items an air of legitimacy to ease their sales. Other museums said that, as needed, they continue to investigate the ownership histories of the objects in their collections that have Latchford links. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, for example, holds 12 pieces directly linked to him. In 2013, it returned two pieces to Cambodian officials. “The Met has long been reviewing objects that came into the collection via Douglas Latchford and his associates,” the Met said in a statement, noting the previous return and ongoing research. “As we continue our research, we will continue this approach, as is appropriate.” News• News• News• The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.

Clinton, 75, was admitted to the University of California at Irvine Medical Center on Tuesday “to receive treatment for a non-Covid-related infection,” his spokesman, Angel Ureña, said in a statement Thursday. On Sunday, Clinton’s fever and white blood cell count were normalized, Alpesh N. Amin, chair of the hospital’s department of medicine, said in a statement. Clinton will return home to New York to finish his course of antibiotics, added Amin, who had been overseeing the team of doctors treating the former president. “On behalf of everyone at UC Irvine Medical Center, we were honored to have treated him and will continue to monitor his progress,” Amin said. Clinton was diagnosed with a urological infection that morphed into an infection of the bloodstream, or sepsis, according to a Clinton aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the former president’s medical status. However, Clinton was never in septic shock, a far more serious and life-threatening condition, the aide said. On Friday, Ureña said all of Clinton’s health indicators were “trending in the right direction” and that his white blood cell count had decreased significantly. On Saturday, the spokesman noted that Clinton would remain hospitalized overnight again to continue to receive intravenous antibiotics. “He is in great spirits and has been spending time with family, catching up with friends and watching college football,” Ureña said in a statement Saturday. “He is deeply grateful for the excellent care he continues to receive and thankful to the many well-wishers who have sent kind words to him and his family. He’s looking forward to getting home very soon.” Clinton’s wife, former first lady and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, was photographed visiting UC Irvine Medical Center several days last week. Bill Clinton was in California earlier last week for an event related to his nonprofit Clinton Foundation and was taken to the hospital Tuesday after reporting that he was not feeling well, according to CNN chief medical correspondent Sanjay Gupta. The issue was not related to the coronavirus or to his heart, Gupta reported after interviews with Clinton’s doctors. Clinton underwent heart bypass surgery in 2004 and had stents placed in 2010. President Biden, during a visit to a Connecticut child-care center Friday, said that he had been “exchanging calls” on the situation and that Clinton seemed “to be really doing well.” Biden spoke with Clinton by phone Friday afternoon, according to deputy White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. “He’s doing fine.

Sheremet  survived, but his news service collapsed. In Russia, a “fourth wave” of coronavirus is setting records in daily infection and death numbers, according to official statistics. But the truth is far worse, say independent demographers and data analysts who are challenging the pandemic data issued by President Vladimir Putin’s government and who, in turn, are facing retribution from authorities. At least three top researchers have been dismissed or have resigned from their posts in government or at state universities amid pressure from bosses. Russia’s official statistics showed 221,313 pandemic-related deaths by mid-October, but the independent demographer Alexey Raksha calculated that excess mortality — seen by analysts as the most reliable indicator of coronavirus deaths — has reached around 750,000. Raksha’s calculation used figures maintained by Rosstat, Russia’s statistical agency. Meanwhile, a report in the Moscow Times estimated the figure at about 660,000. Tracking cases around the world Russian independent analysts say officials manipulated statistics and underplayed the crisis, most likely for political reasons — claims that have been made about governments in other countries, including China and Turkey. Critics alleging data manipulation by governments say the practice is an obstacle to a full global reckoning of the pandemic’s reach. The Russian Ministry of Health and Rospotrebnadzor, the government agency that publishes daily coronavirus numbers, did not respond to requests for comment on allegations of low  counts. Russian official statistics exclude many deaths of patients with the coronavirus where doctors judge another major factor was to blame, such as heart failure. “The data for [Russia] is absolutely unreliable,” said Alexei Kouprianov, an independent analyst and biologist who last year organized a community of experts on social media, Watching Covid. He was fired from the St. Petersburg campus of the Higher School of Economics in September 2020. As Putin’s government tightens political control in the country, the handling of the pandemic has largely been left to the regions. The pandemic has exposed fragilities in a system in which regional officials conceal problems for fear of losing their posts and critics — even analytical experts — are sidelined. Before the pandemic, life expectancy in Russia was 73 years, whereas it was 84 in countries including Australia, Italy and Spain, and its spending on health care was 5.6 percent of GDP compared with 16.8 percent in the United States and more than 10 percent in Japan and much of Europe, according the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Russia’s baths hold onto communal spirit in age of social distancing Russian authorities say their handling of the pandemic has been better than the performance of many Western countries. But with 43 million Russians fully vaccinated by Oct. 14, according to the Health Ministry, about 30 percent of the 144.4 million population, Russia’s vaccination rate is one of the world’s lowest, according to data from the Britain-based Global Change Data Lab. Russia’s rate compares with 56 percent in the United States, 65 percent in Britain and 72 percent in Canada.  Recently, official Russian rhetoric has shifted. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Oct. 11 that mortality rates were high because of the “unacceptably low level of vaccination,” adding that “all conditions have been provided to citizens to save their lives by getting inoculated.” Since Russian parliamentary elections last month, officials and state media have amplified warnings about the dangers of the coronavirus. The daily coronavirus death toll hit a record 1,002 on Friday, and the country surpassed 33,000 daily infection cases, according to state-approved figures.  “Actually, excess mortality now is more than 2,000 people each day on average,” claimed the demographer Raksha, who was fired by the official statistical agency Rosstat last year for exposing alleged undercounting of daily deaths by the reporting agency Rospotrebnadzor. “Hospitals are overloaded,” said Andrei Konoval, the head of the independent Union of Medical Workers. Ambulance drivers were ordered to work 24-hours shifts in Yekaterinburg, the independent Znak media reported. Russian Health Minister Mikhail Murashko on Thursday called on retired doctors to return to work. Putin’s vaccine puzzle: Why the secrecy over his jab? Denis Protsenko, a pro-Kremlin chief of one of Moscow’s main covid-19 hospitals, sounded the alarm Friday, calling the situation “close to critical.” “Guys, the coronavirus is not a joke or a fiction. It is surprising that in the second year of the pandemic, people still need to be convinced of this,” he said, calling on medical colleagues to “start talking in a frank and unadorned way to our compatriots.” Raksha said he thinks that inaccurate statistics sent a message to Russians that the pandemic had been beaten and therefore left space for covid conspiracy disinformation and anti-vaccination propaganda to flood Russian social media. “In Russia, the covid dissidents won,” he said. Kouprianov said covid dissidents targeting the Watching Covid social media page often cited official statistics to argue that “nothing special is happening.” Raksha says he never uses Russia’s official daily statistics on infections and deaths, and “I don’t recommend anyone to do it.” In Russia, a regional official typically “just draws a line by hand to flatten the curve,” he said. “They are just making up numbers, literally.” Russia’s official coronavirus numbers are relatively low. Even Moscow’s mayor is questioning the count. One of his prized possessions is a Soviet statistical yearbook from 1987, one of only 100 copies from the period in 1974 to 1988 when demographic statistics were kept secret. He sees a parallel now: The few Russians who follow the social media pages of reliable independent analysts can find a more accurate picture. Another independent data expert, Alexander Dragan, monitors regional coronavirus surges  by tracking searches on Yandex, Russia’s search engine, and on Google. The correlation with excess mortality has been striking, he said. Tatiana Mikhailova an economist and expert in data analysis, formerly of the prestigious Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration, discovered a pattern in many Russian regions’ reporting on daily cases. Instead of the familiar pandemic curve, the overall case numbers swung wildly in regional reports. Numbers for the main city in region went up one day and the rest of the region’s numbers went down — as if the city and the wider region were taking turns in experiencing surges.  Now booming on Moscow’s black market: Fake vaccine certificates “I discovered this strange pattern in many regions that basically told me that the official statistics are lying,” she said. “They just underreport the cases that they have so as not to show the growth of cases.” After she published her graphs, the academy blocked her from giving interviews, and she resigned rather than be silenced. “If you are working on issues that are critical for society, you have to speak to the press because you have to make your results known to the public,” Mikhailova said. “I think it’s your duty as a scientist.” Doctors are afraid to speak out about the crisis, said Semyon Galperin, the head of the Doctors’ Defense League, an independent association. He said the crisis was sharpened by Russian health system reforms under which more than half the nation’s hospitals and clinics shut down between 2000 and 2015 and thousands of medical workers left the profession. “The result of these reforms is a broken system,” he said. Unreliable information about the pandemic and vaccines made it worse, he added. “We don’t know what is going on. Nobody can say what the exact situation is,” he said. “Nobody trusts anyone anymore. \n Natasha Abbakumova contributed to this report.

The Washington Post", "author": "Teo Armus", "date": "6:00 a.m. EDT", "body": "It was at the townhouse with the black welcome mat — a skinny beige building on South Floyd Street — where Alex Sprague managed to collect Signature No. 4. “I’m starting a petition to get this street renamed. Is that something that interests you?” the 25-year-old asked upon ringing the doorbell, clipboard in hand. The man standing inside, barefoot and in sweatpants, was halfway through shutting the door before curiosity got the best of him. “What are you renaming it to?” he asked. “And why?” Like many of his neighbors, the man had given little thought to the namesake for this quiet, four-block strip in Alexandria’s Seminary Hill neighborhood: former Virginia governor John Buchanan Floyd, a brigadier general in the Confederate Army. But as Sprague explained, Floyd is not the only Confederate whose name appears on nearby addresses. At least 40 other streets in this Northern Virginia city also honor Confederate leaders, largely thanks to a city ordinance that at one point required it for all new roadways running north to south. Following last year’s summer of demonstrations for racial justice, Alexandria officials drastically lowered the bar in August to shed some Confederate names from the map. A petition signed by 25 percent of property owners along a given street, down from 75 percent, is now required to raise the question before city lawmakers. So Sprague has made it a personal mission to knock on door after door, hoping to replace the generals’ names with those of figures on the other side of history: Janneys Lane would now be named after Elijah E. Cummings, the civil rights figure and Maryland congressman who died two years ago Sunday. Van Dorn Street would now honor Breonna Taylor, the Black woman fatally shot by Louisville police in her apartment. And Floyd Street would be renamed in honor of George Floyd, whose killing forced many local governments — including Alexandria’s — to further confront their own role in perpetuating racial injustice. “You should’ve led with that,” the man at the door told Sprague. As one of the oldest cities in the country, Alexandria boasts no shortage of Civil War iconography. Lee Street, in the city’s historic Old Town, bears the name of the military family that lived in the neighborhood, including a young Robert E. Lee. Most of the city’s Confederate streets, however, did not exist until midway through last century. In 1951, Alexandria planning officials — “impassioned with the glory of the Civil War,” as one local newspaper article put it — wrote it into city code that all new north-south streets should be named after Confederate military officials. “The naming wasn’t done naturally,” City Council member John T. Chapman (D) said in an interview last week. “It was done as a way to keep the Lost Cause alive. … They said, ‘We are going to make sure our Confederate soldiers are preserved even if they never even stepped foot in Alexandria.’” That ordinance was largely ignored starting in the 1960s, before city lawmakers formally repealed it in 2014. But the street names remained. It wasn’t until after the protests last summer that local officials decided to again take a look at a tabled proposal to amend the city’s renaming policies, said Tony LaColla, Alexandria’s chief city planner. By then, the city and its neighbors had already begun to reckon with the Confederate grip on many of their most prominent thoroughfares. Alexandria, and then Virginia state legislators, pushed to rename Jefferson Davis Highway. In 2015, the city ended its practice of occasionally hanging three Confederate flags from traffic-light poles near “Appomattox,” a statue of a Confederate soldier. Six years later — a week after Floyd’s killing — that statue was taken down. Arlington poised to rename Lee Highway after John M. Langston, a trail-blazing Black abolitionist congressman Chapman, who serves on the city facilities naming committee, said the matter of renaming gets more complicated when dealing with shorter streets and residential neighborhoods. Landlords and business owners may be reluctant to fork over large sums of money to change deeds and addresses. That’s why the city is merely testing the waters, he noted, with a pilot program that — for only the first three petitions — will lower the threshold of support needed. “You pick a number that doesn’t presuppose an outcome,” Chapman said. “If you have 25 percent [of property owners], that means you’ve just opened the door to have an additional conversation.” The lower percentage goes into effect automatically for 41 streets confirmed to have Confederate namesakes. If petitioners can prove a different name has Confederate origins — 27 others streets are being examined — the bar will also lower for those streets, from 75 percent to 25 percent. Then the request goes to the naming committee, and then the City Council. But Alexandria officials will not lead the charge themselves. “The city,” LaColla said, “is not in the business of changing street names. We’re letting it be a citizen-led initiative.” Much of the initiative has come from Sprague and a tiny group of activists, Reconstruction Alexandria. Animated by citywide conversations over the summer, they have set their sights on stripping every Confederate namesake from the map. “I don’t think streets should be honoring folks who tried to undermine our democracy. Streets should honor people who tried to speak up,” Sprague said. “And I feel like if I don’t do it, who will?” So far, it has been a rather lonely battle. Residents on Janneys Lane have laughed or raised their voices, the activists said, telling them they have their history wrong. On Columbus Street in Old Town — which the group is also targeting — Sprague recalls being chased down the block while trying to garner signatures to replace the navigator’s name with that of Anthony S. Fauci. Columbus monuments are coming down, but he’s still honored in 6,000 places across the U.S. On Floyd Street  last week, Sprague seemed to face far less hostility. Russell Miller, who lives in a brick house on the corner, had never made the connection to Gen. Floyd. But the decision to sign was easy. If the general “represented four years of treason and oppression,” said Miller, a transgender man, “George Floyd represents the struggles of all of us minorities that are killed and abused and underrepresented.” But short of the necessary signatures, on Floyd Street or in any other part of the city, the group has their work cut out for them. The biggest challenge will probably be on Lee Street in Old Town, where a number of residents have clashed on how that block was named — Was it after the Confederate general or his mother? Does it matter? — and whether the name should change. Although Reconstruction Alexandria is pushing to call it Wanishi Street, after a Piscataway word meaning “thank you,” some of the street’s residents are considering other proposals. Yvonne Weight Callahan, who lives on Lee, said that any push to rename a street — Lee, Floyd or otherwise — needs to account for when the name was chosen and what the original namesake is best remembered for. A memorial for dead soldiers right after the Civil War, she said, should be considered differently than a Confederate name chosen during the Massive Resistance movement of the 1950s. “If this Floyd Street was named during the ’50s, of course you would stop and think about why,” she said. “But now that we’ve had the benefit of 70 years since, then the dialogue needs to be on which episodes of this person’s life we should be considering. … Are we erasing history by erasing his name on a street? I think so, maybe.” Her next-door neighbor Kate Cinelli, a 40-year-old professional violist, said the historical context around the Civil War was being misunderstood in the debate. And she lamented that “a bunch of White people,” rather than the descendants of enslaved people, were the ones engaging in this discussion. “Streets should not be named after people who fought to keep slavery,” she said. “Why is this complicated?” News• News• News• The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.

It turned out that ‘she’ was actually three men.   - The Washington Post", "author": "Miriam Berger", "date": "9:55 a.m. EDT", "body": "The work of one woman was, it turned out, the equivalent of the labors of three men. That was at least the case for Spain’s top writer of crime thrillers, a professor and mother who wrote under the pseudonym Carmen Mola, supposedly to maintain her anonymity. But on Friday night, at a ceremony to award the 1 million euro (about $1,160,000) Planeta literary prize to Mola for her historical thriller “The Beast,” three men ascended the podium and claimed the award instead. Mola’s gripping, often-gory novels starring strong female protagonists have been likened to the work of Elena Ferrante, a pseudonym for a widely popular Italian writer. Mola is best known for a trilogy starring a “peculiar and solitary” female police inspector “who loves grappa, karaoke, classic cars and sex in SUVs,” according to publisher Penguin Random House. That trilogy has been translated into 11 languages and is being adapted for television. Last year, a branch of Spain’s Women’s Institute listed Mola’s “The Girl,” a part of the trilogy, as one of the must-read books and films by women that “help us understand the reality and the experiences of women.” How the pandemic set back women’s progress in the global workforce Mola’s latest work, “The Beast,” is a historical thriller centered on the murder of children in Madrid during a cholera outbreak in 1834.  Except the writers spinning these tales were really Jorge Díaz, Agustín Martínez and Antonio Mercero — established Spanish television scriptwriters in their 40s and 50s. “Carmen Mola is not, like all the lies we’ve been telling, a university professor,” Díaz said after winning the Planeta prize, the Financial Times reported. “We are three friends who one day four years ago decided to combine our talent to tell a story.” The trio have said they chose the name by chance and for fun — without paying any particular thought to the gender of the name or the possible implications. “I don’t know if a female pseudonym would sell more than a male one, I don’t have the faintest idea, but I doubt it,” Mercero told Spain’s El País newspaper. “We didn’t hide behind a woman, we hid behind a name.” Others disagreed. “Quite apart from using a female pseudonym, these guys have spent years doing interviews,” Beatriz Gimeno, a former head of the Women’s Institute, wrote on Twitter after the award’s announcement. “It’s not just the name — it’s the fake profile that they’ve used to take in readers and journalists. They are scammers.” Women are systematically excluded from global coronavirus coverage, experts say The author page for Mola on their agent’s website includes a black-and-white photo of a slim woman with her back turned to the camera. “It hasn’t escaped anyone’s notice that the idea of a university professor and mother of three who taught algebra classes in the morning then wrote ultraviolent, macabre novels in scraps of free time in the afternoon made for a great marketing operation,” Spain’s El Mundo newspaper wrote in an interview with the authors. In the past, countless women have published under male pseudonyms to protect their privacy and circumvent commercial and social biases against female writers.

Test your knowledge. - Washington Post", "author": "Natalie B. Compton", "date": "None", "body": "For a practice thatâs roughly traced to the 17th century, tipping remains a surprisingly confusing practice in modern-day America. The practice â whether on a physical transaction or a digital one â still elicits stress in consumers who arenât certain whom to give extra money to, and how much. Then thereâs the pandemic and its impact on hospitality, which made the process even more complicated. Restaurants added service charges, hotel housekeeping morphed, and there were fewer personal interactions. Maybe youâre comfortable on your home turf, knowing to tip your local barista or neighborhood bartender, but what happens when youâre out of your element? We interviewed etiquette and hospitality experts to clear up some confusion about the custom in America â after all, weâre not born with this information. âWe look for rules, and we look for guidelines, and those are important,â says David Coggins, author of the New York Times best-selling book âMen and Manners.â âBut if you already decide that youâre going to be generous or err on the side of generosity, then youâre always going to make a better decision than if you try to think, âHow little can I get away with?ââ Do you know the rules? Test your tipping knowledge with our quiz below. Yes No Correct! In âMen and Manners,â Coggins writes exactly that: Youâre not fully dressed if you have no cash. As Americans appear to be moving toward a cashless future, tipping becomes more of a calculated effort. âIâm obsessed with not being out of small bills, and I try to think about that ahead of time,â Coggins says. You have to be mindful about having cash on you so you donât stiff those deserving gratuity. If you can, stock up on small bills before your trip. In a pinch, you can compensate for being cashless by asking the person helping you for their digital wallet information such as their Venmo or Cash App handle. âMost people nowadays have Venmo, Paypal or Zelle,â says Ben Pundole, a hotel consultant and founder of A Hotel Life travel website. Such a request may not be normal or expected for all generations, but âitâs not abnormalâ either, he said. Try again! Yes No Correct! When someone touches your bag, you tip. Founder and chief executive of the Protocol School of Palm Beach Jacqueline Whitmore recommends $1 per bag, unless itâs extra heavy (then give $2 per bag). If the driver just drops you off, and you handle your bags, there isnât a need for gratuity. Try again! Yes No Try again! Correct! Keep your singles to yourself on a flight. Most airline staff members are asked to decline tips. âThe best way our customers can recognize our team members is by sending a note to our customer relations team,â said Ross Feinstein, the former director of operations communications at American Airlines. Yes No Correct! Swann School of Protocolâs founder, Elaine Swann, recommends tipping according to how many bags are handled at curbside check-in. âWhen theyâre bringing your bags from your car and theyâre checking them for you: $2 per bag,â she says. Try again! Yes No Try again! Correct! Tipping time is flexible here. It can be at the beginning or end of a stay. There is no hard-and-fast rule on when you should tip hotel staff, so make sure you have small bills to hand out when the situation arises. Yes No Correct! You should absolutely tip your valet attendant, preferably when you hand them your keys. This is a great example of gratuity to ensure proper service â you want the valet on your side. Swann recommends tipping valet drivers $3 and up. âTip them in the beginning and theyâll always look after you,â Pundole says. âThe more you look after them, the more they look after you.â Try again! Yes No Try again! Correct! A hotel manager tends to be a salaried employee who doesnât require a tip. A clue for who to tip and who to skip is to look at how the hotel employee is dressed. âI donât tip someone in a suit from behind the counter,â Coggins says. âGenerally, if a person is wearing a suit or their own clothes, I donât. Theyâre a manager of some higher position and so you donât need to tip them. But if itâs a person in a uniform, you generally do.â Yes No Correct! How much will depend on what kind of hotel youâre at, and what kind of service youâre getting. Did they drop your bags and go quickly? Did they help you unpack, or share helpful details about the room and hotel? Pundole recommends up to $10 for a tip at a luxury hotel. Not everyone wants the help, and thatâs okay, too. âI used to avoid the bellmen and want to do everything myself,â Pundole says. But ultimately, remember that theyâre here to help. âTheyâre proud to be standing at the front of something great and being the first point of contact.â Try again! Yes No Correct! Not everyone knows to tip the cleaning staff, or they choose not to for various reasons. But according to all of our experts, you absolutely tip housekeeping. Itâs a thankless hotel job that often gets overlooked. In his early traveling days, Coggins didnât know to tip housekeeping, an error heâs still embarrassed about today. Itâs now natural for him to tip housekeeping at every hotel. âSome people avoid it because they think theyâre doing it incorrectly, or they donât know if itâs going to be appreciated, or they donât even have the pleasure of handing it to someone,â Coggins says. âThey work really hard. They work long hours,â Pundole adds. âThereâs a level of expectation that they do an exemplary job. They deserve it.â Pundole recommends tipping $10 per day of your visit. However, housekeeping as well as other hospitality elements have changed during the pandemic, and customers may notice a drop-off in services some cases. Pundole recognizes that while service should be rewarded, itâs not a given. People should tip what they can. Try again! Yes No Try again! Correct! All-inclusive properties and cruises can come with rules of their own. âA lot of times the cruise line will give you a guideline on tipping,â Swann says. âThey break it down day by day. Server by server. Follow the guidelines of the cruise line. As far as the rest of the waitstaff is concerned, you would tip the same way on land â if the cruise line allows it.â Yes No Correct! Stephanie Fisher, a certified travel associate for Huffman Travel, says she always adds gratuity, noting that the charges you pay on the app might not directly get to the driver. Weâve heard stories during the pandemic of delivery drivers receiving few tips even as demand and risks have increased. For travel adviser Thomas Chongruk of Escape 2, an independent affiliate of Montecito Village Travel, the answer is yes. While he doesnât think the gesture is mandatory, he feels that it is a courtesy to the person who delivered your meal. Pundole finds some service charges to be exorbitant these days, but he tips a few bucks in-person irrespective of the digital transaction.

At one such meeting earlier this year, a Biden aide responded that Democrats would simply have to “out-organize” the other side, according to multiple advocates familiar with the exchange who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a private meeting. The comment infuriated advocates, who believe they are watching former president Donald Trump actively and perhaps permanently undermine faith in U.S. elections. “There’s been a lot of anger and frustration with that line from the White House, which was communicated as a response to advocates wanting the White House to do more,” said Aaron Scherb, legislative director of Common Cause, a longtime pro-democracy group. Scherb conceded that the White House’s urgency has significantly amped up in recent days, as voting rights legislation comes up for debate on Capitol Hill, and White House officials denied the activists’ account of the meeting. But the ongoing frustration is widespread among activists and many Democrats who fear Biden is missing the urgency of the moment. In the nine months since Biden took office, GOP officials throughout the country have baselessly challenged the 2020 results, conducting elaborate and clumsy audits. States have restricted voting, often in ways activists say will hurt disadvantaged communities, and have changed their procedures to allow political influence over future elections. Trump, meanwhile, frequently proclaims — with much fury but no evidence — that the last election was stolen, and some Republicans routinely assert that upcoming votes will be rigged as well. Many in Trump’s camp have taken to lauding the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, which was aimed at violently overturning the last election, as a heroic act. Activists want Biden to provide a loud, clear voice against these moves, from prime-time speeches to regular denunciations of especially egregious actions. Beyond that, they say he should throw himself into passing voting rights legislation and more aggressively go after states that are politicizing their election systems. White House spokesman Andrew Bates said the account of the meeting with voting rights advocates was false. “No White House official has ever said that our strategy relied on ‘out-organizing’ anti-voter laws,” Bates said. “The president and vice president’s approach is comprehensive, and it includes passing voting rights legislation and using executive authority, the bully pulpit, the convening power of the White House, organizing, and a host of other tools.” Still, in the months since taking office, Biden’s time and energy have largely been focused elsewhere. Shoring up democracy was not among the four crises — coronavirus, the economy, climate change and racial equity — that he promised to tackle upon taking office. He has not yet devoted a full prime-time address to the topic, as he did in March to commemorate the first anniversary of pandemic shutdowns. His top priorities in Congress right now are an infrastructure bill and a social safety-net package. The Senate next week is again expected to take up voting rights legislation, which the administration and outside groups view as critical, but it has little chance of passage without changes to the Senate filibuster. “I think the pulpit could be bullier,” said Damon Hewitt, the executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. Derrick Johnson, president of the NAACP, said the administration’s lack of urgency about safeguarding democracy, especially by shoring up voting rights, is “appalling . . . I have heard from many of my colleagues and members that the lack of priority around voting rights will be the undoing of the legacy for this presidency.” Hewitt, who met with Biden at the White House alongside other civil rights leaders in July, said it is a mistake for activists to put the onus entirely on the Biden administration to protect democratic institutions. But he said he would like to see the president be more forceful in attacking voting restrictions. For many Biden allies, what they see as his tepid response is especially jarring when matched against his urgent rhetoric during the campaign, which framed his entire candidacy as an effort to restore and protect democracy. He announced his candidacy in a short video that was light on biography and policy — and instead revolved around the 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, warning that “our very democracy” was at stake and casting his campaign as an urgent mission to combat the threat posed by Trump. After winning the Democratic nomination, Biden similarly framed his candidacy as crucial to the effort to “save our democracy.” And just hours after the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, Biden — taking the stage in Wilmington, Del., before Trump addressed the nation — renewed his calls to fortify the country’s institutions and ideals, exhorting, “The work of the moment, and the work of the next four years, must be the restoration of democracy, of decency, of honor, of respect, the rule of law.” Many pro-democracy groups and advocates say they are “anxiously optimistic” — in the words of Michael Waldman, president of the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law — that the administration will ultimately turn its full focus to safeguarding democracy, but they are frustrated by the dearth of tangible results so far. Even some top Democrats are expressing public concern, worried that moves by Republican state officials — like making election overseers more beholden to political leaders — could set back their party for a generation. On Wednesday, Hillary Clinton tweeted out an article titled, “How the GOP Will Try To Subvert Our Elections,” by Marc Elias, a Democratic lawyer focused on voting rights who was the general counsel of her 2016 presidential campaign. “I fear Democrats still aren’t taking this threat sufficiently seriously,” Clinton wrote. Administration officials dispute these characterizations, saying Biden and his team recognize the threat and are doing all they can. “As the president said explicitly, these radical assaults on constitutional rights and on American democracy constitute ‘the most significant test of our democracy since the Civil War’ and voting rights legislation is a must-pass ‘national imperative,’ ” Bates said. Simply because the president is not answering Trump’s every false provocation about the 2020 election does not mean he’s not fiercely engaged, aides say. “If we tried to debunk every lie that President Trump told — during my career in Congress, it was like 17,000 of them — so we would stay busy all day, every day,” said Cedric L. Richmond, a senior White House adviser and former Louisiana congressman. The White House, for example, fully backs plans by Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) to hold a procedural vote soon on a compromise voting rights bill that Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) helped craft in hopes of winning Republican votes. The legislation is not expected to advance, but Schumer hopes the vote will demonstrate that Republicans are refusing to work with Democrats on the issue, increasing pressure on his own party to change the filibuster rules and push through an expansion of voting rights. In March, Biden signed an executive order to promote voting rights, directing federal agencies to develop a plan to encourage voter registration and participation, among other measures. Biden has asked Vice President Harris to take on voting rights as an area of focus, and last summer she announced a $25 million expansion of the Democratic National Committee’s “I Will Vote” initiative, which focuses on voter protection, education and registration. Biden officials also argue that legal actions can be more effective than aggressive speeches. The Justice Department has announced a doubling of its voting rights enforcement staff, and in June, the department sued Georgia over new voting restrictions that it alleged deliberately discriminate against Black Americans More recently, the White House waived executive privilege for some of the Trump-era documents being sought by the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attacks, a move officials say is in the interest of protecting democracy. Richmond argued that these actions reflect the White House approach of taking the actions that will accomplish the most, not those that are necessarily the loudest or most public. “Many people may want to see the president’s involvement on cable news or on TV, but that’s probably not the most effective way to get this legislation done,” he said. “This is not about ego for us. This is about results.” The problem with that argument, several advocates said, is that millions of Americans are steadily absorbing disinformation from Trump and his allies, and even many moderates have come to question the integrity of U.S. elections. The moment demands a loud and public campaign to shore up faith in American democracy, they said. Biden’s defenders argue that there is real risk in responding to Trump’s every provocation, saying doing so amplifies his false and baseless claim that the election was stolen. They also contend that he has in fact spoken passionately about democracy at several high-profile moments, including his inauguration — which he described as the triumph of “the cause of democracy”  — and before a joint session of Congress in April. “The insurrection was an existential crisis, a test of whether our democracy could survive,” Biden told the lawmakers at the time, before concluding, “We have to prove democracy still works, that our government still works and we can deliver for our people.” During a July speech on voting rights at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, the president pushed back on Trump’s false claims of election fraud, saying, “the ‘big lie’ is just that: a big lie.” At the Justice Department, meanwhile, Attorney General Merrick Garland has spoken of  restoring the norms established by Edward H. Levi, the attorney general in the wake of the Watergate scandal. Garland has a portrait of Levi hanging in his conference room, as well as one of Attorney General Elliot L. Richardson, who refused Richard M. Nixon’s order to fire Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox and instead resigned, in what became known as the Saturday Night Massacre. White House officials have told voting-rights advocates that Biden will not pressure Garland on voting rights, because the president believes it is more important to restore the department’s independence in the wake of Trump’s presidency. Biden also makes another argument, one that particularly exasperates activists: The best way to strengthen democracy, he contends, is to show that it works, by passing the infrastructure and other bills. But even inside the administration, some worry that too much emphasis on enacting Biden’s spending priorities could come at the expense of the need to safeguard democratic institutions. And the approach is deeply unsatisfying to those who see the threat to democracy as akin to a house on fire. Biden’s hope that Americans will support Democrats, and democracy more broadly, if he delivers results, could be torpedoed by restrictive voting laws that make it harder to cast ballots in the first place — or by undemocratic forces with the power to reject the results of the 2022 or 2024 elections. “Stacking election administrators and providing access to the means to control the levers of elections” is a growing threat, said Sophia Lakin, deputy director of the ACLU’s Voting Rights Project. Polls suggest that the advocates’ concern is warranted, in that the public’s faith in democracy is being badly eroded. Surveys consistently find that about 1 in 3 Americans — and more than 6 in 10 Republicans — doubt the legitimacy of the 2020 election, despite overwhelming evidence that it was fairly decided. A CNN poll in September found that 52 percent of Americans were not confident that U.S. elections reflect the will of the people. And changes are underway across the country that could exacerbate that distrust. According to the Brennan Center’s most recent voting laws roundup, as of the end of September, more than 425 bills with provisions that restrict voting access had been introduced in 49 states. And 19 states had already enacted 33 laws making it harder for Americans to vote. But allies, and even some critics, say there is a limit to what Biden can do, since individual states have so much power to determine their own election procedures. “Honestly, this is just not an area where they can do much,” said Ben Ginsberg, a Republican elections lawyer and Trump critic. Ginsberg recently helped launch a nonprofit network to provide elections administrators with free legal help. Waldman said the most powerful thing the administration can do is help push voting rights legislation through Congress, where so it far it has stalled amid the Democrats’ slim majorities, including a 50-50 split in the Senate. “The president can’t wave a magic wand to make things happen, and simply using the bully pulpit does not guarantee results,” Waldman said. “President Biden’s words when he has talked about this have been very powerful — but it has not so far been a clear, consistent, urgent priority.” \n \n \n Scott Clement and Annie Linskey contributed to this report.

protection, security measures for MPs - The Washington Post", "author": "Annabelle Timsit", "date": "11:08 a.m. EDT", "body": "The British government is considering enhanced security measures for members of Parliament, including sending police protection when they meet with constituents at regular town hall-style events, in the wake of the knife attack that resulted in the death of long-serving lawmaker David Amess. Home Secretary Priti Patel told Sky News on Sunday that the government is considering multiple measures, including asking constituents to pre-book appointments with their elected representatives for public meetings — as the second killing of a British lawmaker in five years sparks a debate over the best way to keep lawmakers safe but accessible to the public. Killing of British lawmaker highlights risks to elected officials around the world Patel insisted that the killing — which police declared an act of terrorism possibly linked to Islamist extremism — should not stop lawmakers from engaging openly with constituents. “This should never, ever break that link between an elected representative and their democratic role, responsibility and duty to the people who elected them,” she said. “For me and for the government, this is about safeguarding our democracy and enabling our elected representatives to carry on doing what they do, serving the public,” she added. A day earlier, she stood by the tradition of regular face-to-face meetings between lawmakers and constituents known in Britain as “surgeries,” telling journalists from the scene of the attack, “we cannot be cowed by any individual.” It’s not clear whether one of the government’s main suggestions — to limit attendance at the town halls to those who have preregistered — would be able to prevent incidents of violence. Sky News reported Sunday that the suspect in Amess’s killing booked an appointment to see the lawmaker. (The Cabinet Office and Essex Police referred questions to the Metropolitan Police, which declined to comment.) Amess, 69, a long-serving Conservative member of Parliament who represented Southend West in Essex, was stabbed to death Friday while meeting with constituents in a local church annex. Authorities arrested a 25-year-old male suspect, whom local media identified as Ali Harbi Ali and described as a British national of Somali origin. He is being held for questioning in London under the Terrorism Act. After lawmaker’s slaying, British media outlets name suspect as possible terrorism links are probed The speaker of the House of Commons, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, told Times Radio on Sunday that David Amess’s coat of arms will be erected in the chamber of Parliament and said lawmakers would pay tribute to him Monday afternoon in a special session followed by a church service. Amess was a Catholic who was known for his support of animal rights and his opposition to abortion. Members of the Muslim community of Southend-on-Sea condemned the killing. In a joint statement, representatives of local mosques said, “This act was committed in the name of blind hatred, and we look forward to the perpetrator being brought to justice.” The violent attack reminded many of the 2016 killing of Labour Party lawmaker Jo Cox, who was repeatedly shot and stabbed as she headed to meet constituents by Thomas Alexander Mair, a white supremacist who is serving a life sentence for the crime. Cox’s husband, Brendan, writing in the Sun newspaper over the weekend, said, “we can’t sustain a democracy effectively if our MPs are targets like this.” “We face the unenviable choice of enhancing their security — and in doing so making them less approachable and accessible, or continuing as we are, but at huge personal risk. I hope we can find a middle way,” Cox wrote, calling on the government to tackle extremism in all its forms. Several lawmakers have suggested changes to the way the town hall meetings are conducted given the killings of Cox and Amess and the threats they face on social media in an increasingly polarized political environment. Labour Party lawmaker Chris Bryant, in an editorial for the Guardian calling for Britain to “get serious about MPs’ security,” said it was time for greater police protection for elected representatives, an end to anonymity on social media, and preregistration for constituency meetings. “It’s in the nature of our constituency system that many constituents don’t just know where our office is, they know where we live,” Bryant said. “That openness is absolutely central to our democracy and we must never surrender it.” However, he added, “there must be a review of all MPs’ security arrangements, both in Westminster and in the constituency.” “Sensible measures maintained and regularly reviewed can protect that pearl of great price — democratically elected representatives that are easily but safely accessible. We don’t want to live in fortresses. But I don’t want to lose another colleague to a violent death.” Separately, Conservative lawmaker and chair of the defense committee Tobias Ellwood told BBC Radio that fellow lawmakers should shift their constituency meetings to Zoom, and called for a “temporary pause in face-to-face meetings” until the review of lawmakers’ security is complete. “There are other ways” to meet, he said. “You can actually achieve an awful lot over the telephone, you can get things moving far faster than having to wait for the surgery date as well.” Not everyone agrees. Hoyle, the speaker of the House of Commons, told Times Radio that someone recently threatened to put a bomb under his car — but that he is against restricting in-person meetings with constituents even as he agreed there should be a review of security measures. Hoyle, who wrote in the Observer and the Daily Mail on Sunday that hosting his own meeting with constituents in Chorley hours after Amess’s stabbing reinforced how vital they are, said: “The very essence of being an MP is to help and be seen by our constituents. They are the people who elected us to represent them, so surely making ourselves available to them is the cornerstone of our democracy?” Lawmaker and former cabinet minister David Davis said he wouldn’t take the government up on the offer of police protection and expressed concern about the prospect of distancing elected officials from the public. He said that people who come to in-person meetings are often “the people for whom there is nothing else left,” according to Sky News. Still, some lawmakers acknowledged the risks. Labour MP Wes Streeting also told the outlet, “we’re having difficult conversations with our own families.” “This is not just about us,” he said, “it’s about the safety of our staff, the people who work for us; it’s about how our families feel when we go off to work, and the conversations that particularly our colleagues who are parents have been having with their children in the last day or so about why our job is important and why it’s worth the risk.” Patel said Saturday that every member of Parliament has been contacted by authorities since Amess’s killing to ask about “their whereabouts, what they’re doing in their constituency, to make sure that they are protected, so that they can go around, serving their constituencies in that open way, but in a safe way. It’s important that that continues.” Read more: Killing of British lawmaker highlights risks to elected officials around the world ‘White supremacist’ convicted in slaying of British lawmaker Jo Cox Killing in Britain spawns a reckoning over rhetoric on eve of E.U. vote The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.

Streaming service Spotify announced this weekend that the British singer’s new single “Easy on Me,” which was released Friday, broke a new record for the most streams in a single day. “On Friday, October 15th, Adele’s Easy On Me became Spotify’s most-streamed song in a single day,” the audio company wrote on social media as fans celebrated the star’s record-breaking comeback. Amazon Music on Saturday announced that the single had received “the most first-day Alexa song requests in Amazon Music history.” The single is taken from her highly-anticipated album “30,\" which is set to be released on Nov. 19. Her previous album, “25,” which was released in 2015, had the highest first week sales in U.S. album chart history – and included the hit “Hello” which became the fastest video to reach 1 billion views on YouTube. A post shared by Adele (@adele) While Spotify did not divulge a precise figure of how many people listened on release day, “Easy on Me\" stole the crown from K-pop boyband BTS which had held the top spot for most streams in one day for their single “Butter,” released in May 2021. According to Billboard, Spotify currently reaches 365 million monthly active users. On social media, many Adele fans used the comments section of Spotify’s Instagram announcement to confess that they helped drive up the tally. “Half of them were from me,” joked one user, while another branded the 33-year-old British musician as “unstoppable.” A post shared by Spotify (@spotify) The star’s albums – “19,″ “21,” “25,” and now “30” – are all named after the age she was at the time of writing her music. “I’m ready to finally put this album out,” the singer wrote in an Instagram post last week, adding that the new music had been her “ride or die throughout the most turbulent period of my life.” It has indeed been a tumultuous few years for the star who has been navigating her divorce from Simon Konecki, with whom she has a 9-year-old son, Angelo. In 2019, the pair announced their split after seven years together. In a recent interview with British Vogue, Adele opened up about the divorce and its impact on her son. “My son has had a lot of questions. Really good questions, really innocent questions, that I just don’t have an answer for. [like] ‘Why can’t you still live together?’” she told journalist Giles Hattersley, adding that she struggled with anxiety as her marriage broke down. “I definitely learnt a lot of tools in my therapy, but I also just go with it,\" she said. \"I find the anxiety gets worse when you try and get rid of it.” During an Instagram Live with fans last week, the star was asked what the new album was about.

The Dolphins and Jaguars kicked things off early in London and Jacksonville ended its 20-game losing streak with a 23-20 victory on a last-second field goal. The early-afternoon window features an AFC clash between the Los Angeles Chargers and Baltimore Ravens, and the late-afternoon slate includes another marquee matchup between the Arizona Cardinals and Cleveland Browns. Follow along for live updates, news and highlights from around the league. What you need to know Cornerback Trevon Diggs, left tackle Tyron Smith and running back Ezekiel Elliott are all active for the Dallas Cowboys for their late-afternoon game at New England. Each had been listed as questionable on the injury report. Diggs, the NFL’s interception leader, missed practices Wednesday and Thursday because of a sprained ankle. He was a limited participant in Friday’s practice. Elliott was limited in practices all week because of a rib and back injury. Smith was plagued by a neck injury. In his first season as the Los Angeles Chargers’ head coach, Brandon Staley has shown no fear of going for it on fourth down — even when the Chargers are deep in their own territory. Many times, it was worked and given his team a boost. But in the fourth quarter of the game in Baltimore, his brazenness backfired. On fourth-and-one at the L.A. 19, the Chargers went for it and Justin Herbert’s pass fell incomplete. That left the Ravens with an easy opportunity to add to their lead and they did just that, with Justin Tucker kicking a 39-yard field goal for a 27-6 lead. That was the second time Staley’s strategy failed and led to easy points for the Ravens. With the Chargers down 14-0 early in the second quarter, Staley kept his offense on the field facing fourth-and-three at their 39. Herbert’s pass was incomplete and Tucker kicked a 59-yard field goal. The Chargers were, at that point, 2-for-8 on third down and 0-for-2 on fourth down. It just keeps getting worse for the New York Giants. On the day they are honoring their 2011 Super Bowl championship team, the Giants trail the Los Angeles Rams, 28-3, at halftime in East Rutherford, N.J. The Giants are 1-4, staring at 1-5. They don’t have a playoff victory since that last Super Bowl title. They’ve made one postseason appearance since then. They were booed off the field following the first half Sunday, and it appears increasingly inevitable that co-owners John Mara and Steve Tisch will have to perform another organizational housecleaning. The interceptions keep coming for Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, even after his mother took to social media to defend him earlier Sunday. Mahomes threw his second interception of the first half at FedEx Field on a play that exhibited the poor decision-making that Mahomes vowed a week earlier to avoid. He dropped the ball after taking the snap, picked it up off the ground, then tried to throw a pass as he was being tackled. The fluttering throw landed in the hands of Washington Football Team safety Bobby McCain. The Chiefs trail, 13-10, at halftime. WFT live updates: Washington Football Team leads Chiefs, 13-10, at halftime Earlier, Randi Mahomes wrote on Twitter that a deflected-pass interception was not her son’s fault. “Ok PEOPLE,” she wrote, “that should not be an interception on the QB… that should be a fumble or anything else.. just putting it out there.. GO CHIEFS..” The Los Angeles Rams are rolling, not surprisingly, at MetLife Stadium. They lead the New York Giants, 14-3, in the second quarter. Quarterback Matthew Stafford has touchdown passes to wide receivers Robert Woods and Cooper Kupp. The three-yard connection to Kupp came on a fourth-and-one play, as Kupp maneuvered himself nimbly into the front corner of the end zone. The Ravens made it touchdowns on six straight possessions over two games and lead the Los Angeles Chargers, 17-0, in the second quarter in Baltimore. The Ravens scored touchdowns on their final four drives in rallying to beat the Indianapolis Colts, 31-25, in overtime last Monday night. They scored touchdowns on their first two possessions against the Chargers. The streak ended with a punt by the Ravens on their third drive Sunday. Then kicker Justin Tucker added a 52-yard field goal after the Chargers failed on a fourth-and-three try from their own 39-yard line. Quarterback Patrick Mahomes said after the Kansas City Chiefs’ loss to the Buffalo Bills a week ago that he had to reevaluate his on-field decision-making and stop throwing interceptions. It’s not working quite yet. Mahomes has been intercepted in five straight games after throwing a first-quarter interception Sunday to the Washington Football Team’s Kendall Fuller on a deflected pass. Even so, the Chiefs lead, 10-3, in the second quarter at FedEx Field. Mahomes has completed nine of 13 passes for 145 yards. Cleveland Browns defensive end Myles Garrett, the NFL’s sack leader, wants everyone to have a happy Halloween, everyone, that is, except for NFL quarterbacks. In celebration of the occasion, the ghoulish Garrett turned his front yard into a graveyard, with an enormous skeleton standing over headstones featuring the names of quarterbacks he has sacked (Joe Burrow, Justin Fields, Justin Herbert, Lamar Jackson and Ben Roethlisberger as well as Kyler Murray and Mac Jones.) The Browns face Murray and the Cardinals Sunday and Jones’s Patriots on Nov. 14. “I was looking closely to see how many of those guys he’s actually sacked already and how many are still on the schedule,” Browns defensive line coach Chris Kiffin told Cleveland.com Friday. “So I think he had it pretty well thought out. It’s perfect.” Running back Kareem Hunt thought it was “real funny” and Coach Kevin Stefanski said it was “more creative” than his decorations. Quarterbacks might not agree and they’re certain to have seen the display, thanks to TMZ. “The backstory of the cemetery? I’m kind of a troll a little bit, and people in my house like to have fun,” Garrett said (via the Akron Beacon Journal). “My family and friends, they thought it would be something cool to do for Halloween.” The New York Giants ruled out rookie wide receiver Kadarius Toney from returning to their game against the Los Angeles Rams because of an ankle injury. Toney had three catches for 36 yards before exiting. The Giants lead the Rams, 3-0, in the first quarter at MetLife Stadium. Toney was active for the game after being listed as questionable on the injury report because of an ankle injury. Fellow wideouts Kenny Golladay and Darius Slayton are on the game-day inactive list for the Giants, along with running back Saquon Barkley. The Arizona Cardinals had an additional positive coronavirus test result returned Sunday for defensive lineman Corey Peters. That was the lone new positive test result for the Cardinals and their game at Cleveland remains on as scheduled Sunday afternoon, according to a person familiar with the situation. The Cardinals said they placed Peters on their covid-19 reserve list. They’ll play the game without Coach Kliff Kingsbury following his positive coronavirus test, announced by the team Friday. Quarterbacks coach Cam Turner and defensive tackle Zach Allen also tested positive and will miss the game, the Cardinals said Friday. The team placed linebacker Chandler Jones on its covid-19 reserve list Tuesday, reportedly because of a positive test. General Manager Steve Keim reportedly also tested positive. Defensive coordinator Vance Joseph and special teams coordinator Jeff Rodgers are to share the head coaching duties against the Browns. It took a trip overseas, an equally downtrodden opponent and a wild finish. But the Jacksonville Jaguars finally got into the win column for Coach Urban Meyer and rookie quarterback Trevor Lawrence. They beat the Miami Dolphins, 23-20, on kicker Matthew Wright’s 53-yard field goal as time expired at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London. The Jaguars snapped their 20-game losing streak dating to last season’s opener. They won for the first time in six games this season since hiring Meyer as their coach in the offseason and using the top overall selection in the NFL draft on Lawrence, the former Clemson standout. Wright provided his game-winner after Lawrence connected for a nine-yard completion to wide receiver Laviska Shenault over the middle on fourth and eight from the Miami 44-yard line. The Jaguars managed to stop the clock with one second left with a timeout. The Jaguars didn’t have a field goal all season until Wright connected from 40, 54 and 53 yards Sunday. On his 54-yarder with less than four minutes to play, the ball seemed headed wide right before hooking back through the uprights and sailing just over the crossbar. The Jaguars got a touchdown in the final minute of the first half and another on their opening possession of the second half to turn a 13-3 deficit into a 17-13 lead. The second touchdown pass of the day from quarterback Tua Tagovailoa to wide receiver Jaylen Waddle put the Dolphins back in front, 20-17, with just more than 10 minutes remaining, before Wright’s final two field goals for the Jaguars. Tagovailoa had those two touchdown passes but also threw an interception in his return from a three-game absence due to fractured ribs. The Dolphins’ record dropped to 1-5. Coach Brian Flores had two failed instant-replay challenges in the fourth quarter, the first on a Dolphins’ incompletion and the second on a punt that was ruled not to have touched the fingertip of the Jaguars’ returner on its way to the end zone. Joe Burrow had an unusual week as the Bengals prepared to face the Lions. Burrow spent the week on “voice rest” after being taken to a Cincinnati hospital last Sunday as a precaution because of a throat contusion he suffered in the Bengals’ overtime loss to the Packers. Burrow did not stay overnight, but the 3-2 Bengals were taking no chances with the No. 1 player taken in the 2020 draft. He skipped his weekly news conference, being advised by the medical staff to speak as little as possible. “Everything’s going good,” Coach Zac Taylor said Wednesday. “We’re just limiting what he has to say and how he’s gotta use his voice through today.” The injury, the result of trauma to the neck, was an odd one, but has the potential to be serious. “If people have trouble breathing or your voice changes, you’ve got to be very aware with someone who got hit in the throat that they don’t have significant injuries,” Timothy Kremchek, Cincinnati Reds’ medical director and a consultant for NFL players at Beacon Orthopaedics, told Cincinnati.com last week. “Typically they’ll go to the hospital and be evaluated by a CT scan just to make sure there are no fractures or threatening injuries.” Burrow was cleared to play Sunday and has thrown for multiple touchdowns in every game this season. If he can do so against the Lions, he would join Dan Marino as the only other quarterback in his first or second season to throw multiple TD passes in his team’s first six games of the season. Bengals receiver Tee Higgins saw no difference in the quarterback during Wednesday’s walk-through, saying he was “the regular old Joe.” Quarterback Daniel Jones is active for the New York Giants for their game against the Los Angeles Rams in East Rutherford, N.J., while tailback Saquon Barkley is on the inactive list. Jones was cleared under the concussion protocol. He practiced on a limited basis Thursday and was a full participant in Friday’s practice. Barkley is inactive because of his ankle injury. He’s joined on the game-day inactive list by wide receivers Kenny Golladay and Darius Slayton. Rookie wideout Kadarius Toney is active. He had been listed as questionable on the injury report because of an ankle injury. Anyone seen David Beckham? How else to explain a 54-yard field goal attempt by Matthew Wright that appeared headed way, way right before suddenly curving between the uprights and tying the score for the Jaguars in London’s Tottenham Hotspurs Stadium? Even Wright seemed surprised, but not as surprised as CBS’s Kevin Harlan, who could only laugh after his errant call. “54 yarder...nope...aaaaannnnd, got it!” he said. “Got it!

He was facing sex trafficking charges at the time of his death in 2019 but was not convicted. This article has been corrected. Last Monday in Manhattan, outside the Fifth Avenue offices of Rolling Stone, dozens of young fans of the South Korean boy band P1Harmony swarmed the building, hoping to catch a glimpse of their idols. The band was upstairs doing a three-song set in the magazine’s Twitch studio, while about 100,000 people watched them via the live-streaming platform. Less than 24 hours earlier, Rolling Stone had unleashed a built-to-go-viral story, with an energetic push on social media and a headline of “Eric Clapton Isn’t Just Spouting Vaccine Nonsense — He’s Bankrolling It.” The story revealed that the British superstar guitarist once dubbed “God” is not only a leading vaccine skeptic himself but a financial benefactor of an upstart anti-vaccine band. The piece also toured Clapton’s history of “full-tilt” racist rants. Rolling Stone, that bible of baby boom rock, is attempting to reinvent itself. Financially troubled for years, and plagued by a major journalism scandal after its flawed University of Virginia rape-case reporting a few years ago, it’s been crawling out of that hole for a while. The print magazine now publishes monthly instead of every other week but is profitable by itself, with a circulation of about 500,000; Rolling Stone as a whole — now owned by Penske Media, which also owns Variety, Billboard and the Hollywood Reporter — started turning a profit in 2019. It reaches about 60 million people a month on various digital platforms, the company says. The next challenge, said president and CEO Gus Wenner when I stopped by his office the other day, is “journalism with teeth”and “a real place in the zeitgeist.” “Our North Star is reestablishing Rolling Stone as the Bible for young people,” he said. “That’s not true now, but we’re on the road.” A  milestone came this summer when Wenner, the 30-year-old son of magazine co-founder Jann Wenner, hired a new editor, Noah Shachtman, who had previously been the top editor at the Daily Beast. Shachtman has a plan. “We are 100 percent going to shine a light on bad actors,” he told me, as we walked through Rolling Stone’s Midtown headquarters, where a dazzling video wall rotates through a history of magazine covers: Mick Jagger, Madonna, Bruno Mars, Beyoncé and of course, Clapton. In doing so, he wants Rolling Stone to stand apart from much of entertainment  journalism, which “tends to be either fawning and borderline embarrassing, or pure gossip.” Though its political coverage has historically been hard-hitting, Rolling Stone was once among the music press that treated the industry’s biggest stars with a certain amount of reverence. But it’s not just tougher stories that Shachtman wants. It’s a “more immediate, more visceral” presentation, the kind of approach that the Internet demands. At the Daily Beast, Shachtman drove digital traffic, often by finding the sexiest element of a story and going hard with it — in headlines, in the lead paragraph, and certainly on social media — and by aggressively breaking news, such as revealing that Mary Trump was the source of her uncle’s tax returns going public or how sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was running a dicey secret charity. When Lindsey Buckingham was out promoting his new memoir, Rolling Stone’s interview was more provocative than most — and Shachtman’s team sold it hard on Twitter: “Lindsey Buckingham compares Stevie Nicks to Trump and his former Fleetwood Mac bandmates to timid Republicans.” Success: Matt Drudge picked it up on his heavily trafficked website, and the piece found hundreds of thousands of readers. Magazines haven’t always been so forthright in flagging the best parts of a story; typically, Shachtman said, “that news would have been left to readers to unearth by themselves.” But that approach is a relic of print; for online readers, if the good stuff isn’t in a headline and part of an intense social media push, they might never see it. More significantly, Rolling Stone wrote a critical piece about country singer Morgan Wallen, reminiscent of Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold’s Pulitzer-winning investigations of Donald Trump’s claims of his munificent charitable donations. After Wallen, while seeking redemption for being caught on video uttering a racial slur, pledged $500,000 to Black-led organizations, Rolling Stone contacted dozens of such  charities and found somewhat scanty evidence of Wallen’s follow-through. “One conversation we had before Noah took the job was whether I’d be prepared to back tough reporting when the inevitable complaints came,” Wenner told me. It didn’t take long  for that to be tested. Wallen, in fact, challenged Rolling Stone’s reporting; the magazine is standing behind it, though the story now carries an update providing a response from Wallen’s representatives, which had been sought earlier but not provided. The magazine also has been working hard to appeal to a younger audience while retaining its loyal readers. It’s rolling out four related cover stories in which new artists are paired with more established ones, such as Olivia Rodrigo with Alanis Morissette, and Kehlani with Alicia Keys. Shachtman wants to expand the boundaries beyond traditional rock and pop; he’d love to be covering the best rap artists from Africa, for example. As a longtime reggae bassist, whose bands played the legendary, now-defunct CBGB in New York and the 9:30 Club in Washington, Shachtman has a serendipitous feeling about this new gig combining music and journalism. “When you get a chance to make retroactive sense of your life, you take it,” he said. Later, as images as disparate as O.J. Simpson, Bob Dylan and Adele scrolled by on the video wall, Shachtman paused to call his challenge “kind of heavy.” When I asked what he meant, he described the magazine’s history as “a lot to live up to.” After all, the magazine was host to decades of memorable journalism —  Hunter S. Thompson’s gonzo adventures, Michael Hastings’s revelations of top U.S. military commanders in Afghanistan mocking government officials back in Washington, and Matt Taibbi’s takedowns of the banking industry. In “Sticky Fingers,” his biography of Jann Wenner, Joe Hagan described the feeling of picking up a copy of Rolling Stone in the old days — “like holding a piece of hot shrapnel from the cultural explosion of the 1960s while it still glowed with feeling and meaning.” But, well, it’s been a while. So now comes another shot at relevance. If reinventing an iconic magazine means taking aim at music’s sacred cows and finding ways to shout from the rooftops, both Noah Shachtman and Gus Wenner seem ready to do just that.

EDT", "body": " Her husband had dozed off by her side, but Jan Buckner Walker could not sleep. Emotionally drained after watching the trial of the police officer accused of murdering George Floyd, she fretted about what the guilty verdict would mean for the Black men in her life. Well past midnight, the corporate attorney turned crossword creator reached for her phone and opened “Typeshift,” a word game that carried the Merriam-Webster brand. She flicked her thumb across the glowing screen, dialing letters up and down to find all the possible word combinations in that day’s puzzle. Within minutes, the grid of mostly brown squares turned turquoise, accompanied by a click signaling success. Seven white letters had appeared: “Lynched.” ‘Lynch him!’: New lynching memorial confronts the nation’s brutal history of racial terrorism “It was unbelievable,” said Buckner Walker, founder and president of Kids Across Parents Down, a Chicago-area company that creates crossword puzzles. “I thought, ‘Are they trolling African Americans?’ Why ‘lynched’?” As Floyd’s death trained attention on systemic racial injustice, society is struggling anew to agree on common standards for language that once seemed broadly acceptable but now is considered off-limits by many. Those debates, which have resulted in the renaming of sports teams and popular food brands, are showing up in surprising places, with dictionary companies, crossword constructors and competitive Scrabble players forced to examine how a single word, devoid of context, can offend and marginalize. “Words either connect or divide us,” said Buckner Walker, 58, who has repeatedly alerted Merriam-Webster to racist insults and other hurtful terms appearing in “Typeshift.” “When our dictionary infuses a pastime that promises joy with toxic language instead, it is retrogressive and powerfully divisive.” In Merriam-Webster’s case, an effort by the 193-year-old dictionary brand to extend its audience reach through mobile gaming collided with its traditional role of registering terms and defining their meaning without passing judgment. “We are dedicated descriptivists, not prescriptivists,” said Peter Sokolowski, a Merriam-Webster lexicographer and editor. “We’re not the language police telling you, ‘Yes, you can. No, you can’t.’ We are simply reporting the facts on how language is used.” Now, however, facing the unfamiliar responsibility of not offending players, Merriam-Webster has also become the arbiter of which words to block from online puzzles. And as other purveyors of word games have discovered, decisions about whether to exclude racial slurs and other offensive terms — including those that might have benign meanings in certain contexts — risk alienating some players and raise challenging questions about power and perspective. Examining a racial slur entrenched in American vernacular that is more prevalent than ever When the North American Scrabble Players Association banned slurs from the word list used in competition in summer 2020, infuriated aficionados argued that words played in the game lack meaning and intent. “When you start taking words out, where do you draw the line?” said Jason Idalski, an advisory board member of the Scrabble association from Ferndale, Mich., who voted against the ban. “No matter where you draw the line, people will say, ‘Why is this word in but not that? Are you inherently saying it’s okay to offend these people and not those people?’” The standards for word-based games continue to evolve. Hasbro Gaming, the company that owns the rights to Scrabble in North America, clarified official rules last summer to also bar derogatory terms. Hasbro spokeswoman Carrie Ratner said the company “will not accept having slurs of any kind in entities created and supported by our company” and noted that Hasbro had begun removing offensive words from “The Official Scrabble Players Dictionary,” published by Merriam-Webster, in 1994, scrubbing more words with each edition. (Tournaments follow a different lexicon.) Mattel, which owns Scrabble in the rest of the world, followed suit this year, removing what the company called “hate speech” from its list of playable words. “As language and connotations change over time, so must Scrabble,” Ray Adler, global head of games at Mattel, wrote in a company blog. The New York Times crossword began running puzzle clues and answers past a diversity panel this year after controversies involving the use of words such as “beaner” and “illegal,” which are racial slurs that also have innocuous meanings. “There is a sense that there should be more care taken with choices of words that could be potentially offensive, whereas before they were just, ‘oh, words in the dictionary, so it’s okay,’” said linguist Ben Zimmer, who leads the New Words Committee of the American Dialect Society. A Merriam-Webster representative alerted The Washington Post to degrading terms appearing in Word Wipe, an online game developed by Arkadium that is published on The Post website and in other outlets. Arkadium said it regularly audits and culls the words that could appear in its games and has taken steps to remove additional terms. “We never want anything to appear that could be offensive, even if the word had a benign origin,” Arkadium chief executive Jessica Rovello said in a statement. Many word puzzle makers already adhere to what’s informally known as the “breakfast table test.” Words that elicit feelings of discomfort if someone is playing a puzzle with their morning cereal — such as “cancer” — would be verboten even though they may also have harmless meanings. Yet Buckner Walker said Merriam-Webster officials were slow to rid “Typeshift” of demeaning terms even after she alerted company executives in December to the appearance of the slurs “Negress” and “darkies.” (The computer-generated anagram game challenges players to form as many words as possible using the letter combinations dealt each day. Players who click on the found words are directed to the Merriam-Webster definitions.) Damien Yambo, the director of educational products, apologized and told her that independent game developer Zach Gage, who controls the “Typeshift” game where the slurs appeared, should have excluded those words. Merriam-Webster licenses its dictionary to Gage in exchange for a daily game that runs on the company website, which company officials said should filter all words the dictionary labels as “offensive,” “vulgar” or “obscene.” The game is also available on the “Typeshift” mobile app, which was prominently branded with Merriam-Webster’s red, white and blue logo, but the dictionary company said it has no oversight over that version of the game. Gage said he added both slurs to the list of words to block from the game shortly after Yambo contacted him. “Nobody playing ‘Typeshift’ should be experiencing a word that is traumatic for them,” Gage said. But after former police officer Derek Chauvin’s murder conviction in April, “lynched” popped up. This time, Buckner Walker contacted Merriam-Webster president Gregory Barlow about the “repeated and painful delivery of racist language” through the game app, according to an April 27 email shared with The Post. Corporate America’s $50 billion promise Barlow responded within hours, followed by two phone calls. “We took the matter very seriously,” he told The Post in a written statement. “I made it clear that it was deeply concerning to me, and promised to take action with the third-party owner of the game.” Barlow said the company demanded that Gage remove the Merriam-Webster logo from the “Typeshift” app. Even after Buckner Walker spoke to Barlow, disparaging terms showed up on the website version of the game that the company does control. The transphobic slur “tranny” appeared on May 19. The racial slur “coons” appeared on Sept. 13. Players on the mobile app, meanwhile, received credit for finding “slave” on July 19, the antisemitic term “hebes” on Aug. 31 and “bitches” on Sept. 24, among other racist, misogynistic and homophobic words observed by The Post in screenshots and in real time. Merriam-Webster removed “Typeshift” from its website on Sept. 24, three days after The Post contacted the company for this report, to update its block list and establish a process to be more responsive to cultural norms and current events. Gage removed the Merriam-Webster logo from the “Typeshift” app that same day. “I firmly believe in not exposing people to offensive words, especially racial, gendered or sexual slurs,” said Gage, a 36-year-old solo developer whose licensing agreement with Merriam-Webster began in 2017. “Any offensive words that appeared in ‘Typeshift’ puzzles were there in error, and when I was informed of them I updated the block list and generated new puzzles.” Company officials said Merriam-Webster plans to seek outside input on expanding its list of blocked words because it is unaccustomed to casting editorial judgment beyond what its dictionary has flagged for offensive usage. Merriam-Webster’s lexicographers add hundreds of new words and definitions to the dictionary each year as language evolves. In 2020, it included “BIPOC” and flagged the word “uppity” as especially offensive when applied to Black people. This year, it added “cancel culture” and “digital blackface” and noted the widely accepted capitalization for “Black.” The strange journey of ‘cancel,’ from a Black-culture punchline to a White-grievance watchword Human vetting of computer-generated online word puzzles is standard for big gaming companies, said Gillian Smith, a computer science professor and director of the interactive media and game development program at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts. Smith said no puzzle creator would have wanted to release a word game with “Afghan” or “Taliban” as answers after the August suicide bombing attack in Kabul that killed 13 U.S. service members and dozens of Afghans. “You might even pause at including a word like 'Marine’ because it’s so contextualized,” Smith said. Zynga, which makes “Words with Friends,” a popular Scrabble-like game, has a policy of eliminating racial slurs and other objectionable words that players flag, said spokeswoman Sarah Ellen Ross. The company employs a team responsible for ensuring that words allowed in the game are inclusive, Ross said, but some players have objected to what they view as the arbitrary nature of determining which words are inappropriate. In the Scrabble world, players expressed confusion and outrage over the list of 259 words characterized as slurs to be banned from competitive play. “Redneck” was blocked. “Redskin” was not, because it also carries a benign definition as a variety of peanut. “Faggot,” despite being a homophobic slur, remains eligible for play because of its archaic meaning of “a bundle of sticks.” Players were also mystified by the exclusion of “Pepsi,” which is used in Canada as an insult against French-speaking Quebecois. John Chew, chief executive of the Scrabble association, which is the governing body for competitive Scrabble in the United States and Canada, and chairman of its dictionary committee, said he expects the organization to revisit the list. “Words like the n-word, they’re not coming back,” Chew said. “We’d all been indoctrinated into this idea that words in Scrabble have no meaning. But there’s nothing special about putting a word on a board that divorces it from the context of the rest of the world around us.” George Floyd’s America: Examining systemic racism and racial injustice in the post-civil rights era Yet clashes are occurring more frequently around other terms as the arbiters of language are forced to consider what words mean outside their own circles. “There are inherent difficulties because people are just not agreeing on what words mean and their level of offensiveness,” said Nicole Holliday, a linguistics professor at the University of Pennsylvania who hosts Slate’s “Spectacular Vernacular” podcast with Zimmer. Holliday, a member of the American Dialect Society, recalled debate over one finalist for the 2020 slang word of the year: “WAP.” While some society members worried that the term made famous by rappers Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion was too sexually explicit, older members nixed it because the pronunciation sounded like “wop,” a slur against Italians. The New York Times was skewered in 2019 for including the word “beaner” in its crossword puzzle. While the clue referred to an informal baseball term, critics pointed out that the solution is also a slur against Mexicans. Crossword puzzle editor Will Shortz apologized, but his defense further angered some. “My feeling, rightly or wrongly, is that any benign meaning of a word is fair game for a crossword. This is an issue that comes up occasionally with entries like GO O.K. (which we clued last April as ‘Proceed all right,’ but which as a solid word is a slur), CHINK (benign in the sense as a chink in one’s armor), etc. These are legitimate words,” Shortz tweeted. “Perhaps I need to rethink this opinion, if enough solvers are bothered.” Shortz later acknowledged that “beaner” is offensive and that it was a mistake to have included that answer. He told The Post in a recent interview about the new standard: “If you see the word out of context, does the word feel benign to the average person?” Still, Shortz said, there is “nothing inherently offensive” about the word “lynch” despite its painful associations. He said he would clue it as “former attorney general Loretta,” whose last name is Lynch. “It would be a shame to say you can’t use this word,” he said. Buckner Walker said she thinks the problems often arise from the lack of diversity among puzzle creators who do not experience the world in the same way she does. “There are triggering events in our lives, and if you abide by the decency of what the breakfast table test demands of you, you can easily avoid traumatizing and offending your consumer base,” she said of “Typeshift” including “lynched.” That word — along with “lynches” — appeared again in the Sept. 26 puzzle for players who had not updated the game app. Those who did download the update received a different set of letters, including those that formed the word “excuses.” Ten days later, on Oct. 6, the racial slurs “chinks” and “chinky” appeared on the updated app. The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.

An Arab Israeli family. An extraordinary gift. - The Washington Post", "author": "None", "date": "None", "body": "By late 2018, Eihab Falah was extremely ill. The 25-year-old Israeli, a member of the Arabic-speaking Druze community, had a rare, aggressive form of brain cancer. Massive doses of chemotherapy and radiation had done little to halt the disease’s progress. Unable to help further, Eihab’s doctors in Israel proffered painkillers and the telephone number of a hospice; surgery, they said, wasn’t an option. His parents and four siblings refused to accept the prognosis. Eihab’s two sisters — doctors themselves — combed the medical world for help. There have only been about 350 documented instances of the cancer, sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma. But ultimately, they found a surgeon in Pittsburgh who had operated on a few such cases. The surgeon agreed to take on Eihab as a patient, and the family prepared to fly to America, anxious but hopeful. Pittsburgh, meanwhile, was in the initial throes of trying to recover from the deadliest antisemitic attack in U.S. history. On Oct. 27, 2018, a gunman had opened fire on worshipers at Tree of Life synagogue, a few blocks from my house in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood. The man killed 11 and wounded six before being arrested by the police. The shooter — an avowed white supremacist who told law enforcement, “I just want to kill Jews” — has pleaded not guilty to 44 criminal counts; he faces the death penalty and is still awaiting trial. He was allegedly motivated by the work of some congregants who had been helping to resettle refugees in Pittsburgh. In the massacre’s aftermath, agents from the FBI’s Victim Services Response Team descended on the city with, among other things, pamphlets and workbooks explaining what residents should expect in the ensuing months. (Yes, the FBI has a special unit devoted entirely to helping communities recover from mass shootings and terrorism.) Titled “Phases of Collective Trauma Response,” one handout showed a squiggly graph with a peak (Heroic Phase) immediately after a shooting, then a deep valley (Disillusionment Phase), followed by a long, slow upward trend (Rebuilding and Restoration Phase). According to the graph, it takes a community 24 to 60 months to recover — which put Pittsburgh smack in the Disillusionment Phase at the end of 2018. That was when the Falahs landed among us in Squirrel Hill.  Eihab Falah grew up in Kofr Smea, a village in Israel’s Upper Galilee where his mother, Fadeeleh, traced her roots back four centuries. He had four siblings. When I visited the family in Israel in August 2019 while reporting this story, Fadeeleh — who had recently retired from teaching Islamic and European history to middle-schoolers — told me that the two eldest, Eihab’s sisters Batla and Eva, had been model children: studious, serious, dutifully mastering musical instruments when pressed by their parents. The boys, on the other hand, just wanted to play sports. But squeezed in between his brothers — Naseeb, the next oldest, and Rami, the youngest — Eihab also possessed a quiet charisma that made the others look up to him. His sisters called Eihab “The Guy We Lean On” and, because of his muscular build, “The Hulk.” His favorite moniker, however, the one that stuck, was “Captain” — bestowed on him by a friend of Eva’s who thought he had a commanding presence. Eihab’s physicality and composure made him a candidate for an elite Israeli army unit when he was conscripted. Druze men are among the rare non-Jews in Israel who serve the same three years of military duty after high school as their Jewish counterparts. Adherents of the Druze religion — a monotheistic sect begun in the 11th century — number around 143,000 in Israel, or less than 2 percent of the population; like their co-religionists, who live mostly in Lebanon, Syria and Jordan, Israeli Druze maintain a fierce loyalty to their country of residence. Eihab breezed through the arduous physical training and was ultimately made squad commander of a dozen soldiers — all of them Jewish. Then, in the middle of one night, Eihab called Eva. He was weeping. As a native Arabic speaker, he had been asked to accompany a mission to pick up a suspected Palestinian terrorist from his home in the West Bank, which Israel has occupied since 1967. Eihab thought they would simply arrest the man and take him into custody. Instead, the soldiers violently broke down the door of the suspect’s house and rushed inside shouting, ransacking drawers and closets, rousing terrified family members from their beds with cocked submachine guns. Amid the chaos, Eihab noticed a small girl perched on a sofa in the dark, crying hysterically. “What did you do?” Eva asked. “I sat down and held her,” said Eihab, trying to stifle his sobs. “I just held her.” Like his parents and siblings, Eihab had always been proud to be Israeli. But this and other distressing, even humiliating, experiences in uniform raised profound questions. He would later say to Eva: Why put myself in harm’s way for people who see me — an Arabic-speaking non-Jew — as the enemy? Or even less than human? His army service convinced Eihab not to pursue a career in the military. Instead, after being discharged, he worked in security for the Israeli railway system during the day to earn money for university and followed a punishing physical training regimen at night. A star of his regional youth-league basketball team while in high school, he had dreams of playing collegiate ball in the United States. But it soon became clear that a knee injury would prevent him from playing basketball at an elite level. Forced to reconsider his future, Eihab had a kind of epiphany: He could stay in athletics by becoming a sports-medicine doctor. Batla was a cardiologist; Eva had almost finished medical school — why not him? In the spring of 2018, Eihab enrolled in a pre-med course, was accepted at a university in Italy, and began learning Italian. His life, it seemed, was finally about to begin in earnest.  Pittsburgh’s Squirrel Hill neighborhood is the kind of place that people never leave. My next-door neighbor, a septuagenarian, raised her children in the house she grew up in. As did my across-the-street neighbor. When the elderly couple on the corner decided to relocate to a nearby apartment, their middle-aged daughter moved right back into the sprawling Tudor-style home of her girlhood, along with her husband. Of course, they had migrated only a block away while raising their kids. You’re not truly a Pittsburgher unless you can claim deep roots. Having come here just 10 years ago, my husband, daughter and I were mere seedlings. Pittsburgh has had well-documented ups and downs: a rise to prominence as a producer of steel, followed by an economic collapse along with the rest of the Rust Belt, followed by a new identity as a medical and academic hub and hipster darling. Squirrel Hill, however, has consistently been an urban Jewish enclave for decades. Jews from Germany, and later Eastern Europe, flocked to Pittsburgh from the mid-1800s onward. The newcomers settled in neighborhoods around the city but by the 1930s had coalesced in Squirrel Hill. And that’s where many of them stayed — even as much of the country’s urban Jewish populace left for the suburbs a few decades later amid a larger trend of White flight. The neighborhood’s Jewish character is unmistakable. The Jewish Community Center’s clock tower, looming over the main commercial intersection at Forbes and Murray avenues, tells the time with Hebrew letters. Within the neighborhood’s 2.9 square miles, a dozen or so synagogues provide for believers of varying ritualistic stripes; the streets on Saturdays are dotted with congregants walking to and from Shabbat services. A local matchmaker does a brisk business. The Jewish population accounts for about 40 percent of Squirrel Hill’s approximately 28,000 residents — meaning that Jews and gentiles have always lived cheek-by-jowl here. People tell the story of a six-alarm fire years ago that tore through Beth Shalom, one of the area’s largest synagogues, causing massive damage to the structure. The synagogue’s director was reportedly inundated with offers of support afterward, not only from the Jewish community but from non-Jewish institutions and residents as well. A fitting sort of response, given that Fred Rogers, the revered children’s television personality who always preached compassion, made his home in Squirrel Hill just a few blocks from me. It is, quite literally, Mister Rogers’s neighborhood.  Eva was vacationing with a cousin in Portugal during a break in her medical training in the summer of 2018 when she received a text from home: Eihab had been hospitalized with blinding headaches. His doctor had at first suspected sinusitis. But after a course of antibiotics failed to relieve the pain, the doctor ordered a scan, then a biopsy when the image revealed a mass. Eva flew home immediately. The diagnosis a couple of days later of sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma was devastating. Rare, difficult to treat and exceedingly aggressive, the malignancy had already penetrated Eihab’s right eye socket. Besides causing the unbearable headaches, pressure from the tumor was also making Eihab’s right eyeball bulge. He started on the first of three rounds of chemotherapy almost immediately, after Batla pulled strings to get him admitted to her hospital. The gastrointestinal effects of the three-drug toxic brew were swift and debilitating; one of Eva’s professors likened it to an artillery barrage. “The doctors saw this big, strong young man, a tiger, and decided they could throw everything at him,” Eva told me. Eihab didn’t leave his hospital room during the six-day regimen except to step outside to smoke marijuana, which his oncologist prescribed to combat nausea. He lost 15 pounds. By the third day, though, his eye had receded, and the headache lifted. The drugs were clearly working. During a break in treatment, Eihab stayed with Batla and her husband, Khalid, in their Jerusalem apartment. Eva, who was doing her medical school rotations at Batla’s hospital, also lived with them. One morning, Eihab yelled from the shower, “Eva, my hair is falling out! I’m going to be bald!” Naseeb and Rami were visiting at the time, along with a male cousin. The boys decided to make a party of it. While Eva shaved Eihab’s head, they gleefully shaved theirs, too. And memorialized it, of course, on social media. At the conclusion of the final rounds of chemotherapy — which Eihab tolerated somewhat better — imaging showed the tumor in almost complete remission. The family was jubilant — no one more so, perhaps, than Rami, who had left his restaurant job in the south by then and moved to Jerusalem to be with his adored older brother. “He was battling, battling, battling,” Rami told me, “so this was great news.” Now Eihab just had to take a short break before beginning radiation treatment that would, with any luck, finish off the tumor completely. He and Rami spent the time planning a motorcycle trip across Europe and maybe even South America. Ten days later, the torturous headaches returned. Eihab’s right eye again began to bulge. A scan showed the tumor had grown back to almost the same size as when first discovered. “I took all this poison,” Eihab said to Eva bitterly, “and for what?” The oncologist immediately began the radiation treatments: six days a week for nearly two months. Eihab developed a terrible fungus in his mouth and throat and could barely eat. He dropped 25 pounds. Still, he managed to finish the full course, along with a new round of chemotherapy. One week after completing the therapies, the white of Eihab’s right eye swelled so badly he couldn’t close the lid. The tumor was now larger than when it was first diagnosed, and extended into a network of channels between the brain’s outermost covering. His doctors were at a total loss. For four punishing months, they had subjected Eihab to a chemical and radiological bombardment — only to have the cancer reappear within days. There was nothing more they could do. Like any family, the Falahs could not accept the judgment. “This was not how my brother’s life was supposed to turn out,” Batla told me. As doctors, she and her sister were determined to use the one medical weapon that had yet to be deployed: surgery. But no one would consider operating because of the tumor’s proximity to Eihab’s brain. That is, until a head-and-neck-cancer expert at another hospital finally suggested a technique capable of destroying tissue precisely; the procedure wasn’t available in Israel, the doctor said, but he knew of a colleague in Pittsburgh who was a specialist. The Falahs were now in a race to figure out how to pay for the operation. Israel’s national health insurance organizations, which cover all citizens, will generally foot the bill for certain treatments not obtainable in the country. Still, the family would have to front the funds before the surgery. The Falahs had to come up with $250,000 — and fast. Eihab’s father, Zaid, who worked as a production manager for a machine-parts manufacturer, sold some tracts of land in the village; Eihab sold his car. That still left them about $125,000 short. Desperate, Eva opened her Facebook page and wrote a post in Arabic, Hebrew and English, detailing Eihab’s battle with his illness and asking for donations: “Our last hope to save his life is a very complicated and costly neurosurgery in Pittsburgh, PA, USA. … Therefore every little help is a great help!” She added a photograph of Eihab and closed her computer. Within hours, Eva’s cellphone was flooded with messages; her online appeal had, in effect, gone viral. The owner of a printing business near Kofr Smea had copied it, churning out reams of posters with Eihab’s picture. He drove around distributing them to the dozen or so villages that make up the Galilee’s Druze enclave. Cars with loudspeakers that usually wound their way through the hilly streets announcing weddings or funerals instead broadcast details of Eihab’s story. Several villages set up collection boxes; those with Christian residents placed them in their churches. Forty-eight hours later, nearly $600,000 had been raised. Eva had to write a post asking people to stop. The gestures of support, both verbal and monetary, spoke to the tightly woven communal fabric of Druze society. Sitting in their Jerusalem apartment and watching all this transpire, the Falahs were overwhelmed, particularly Eihab. An intensely private person, he had previously opposed posting anything about his situation on social media — then watched with a sense of wonder as the unforeseen generosity poured in. The Falahs booked their plane tickets. It was, as Eva said, their last hope.  The morning of Saturday, Oct. 27, 2018, in Pittsburgh felt typical for autumn in these parts: chilly, drizzly, gray. Late as usual, my husband, Dennis, and I were rushing to go to Shabbat services when my cellphone rang. It was Noa, our daughter, who was attending university in Philadelphia. “Where are you?” she asked frantically. “Don’t go out! Don’t leave the house! I just saw a news alert that says there’s an active shooter at a Pittsburgh synagogue.” Dennis turned on the television. A swarm of helmeted police SWAT team members in camouflage flak jackets, guns at the ready, surrounded Tree of Life synagogue (which also housed two other congregations, New Light and Dor Hadash). Evidently a gunman was inside; he had shot an unknown number of people. We stood there stunned, watching, unable to sit, unable to breathe almost. I suddenly realized that I’d been hearing an incessant wail of sirens for the past hour; living only a few blocks from the Squirrel Hill police station, one became oblivious to the sound, a kind of ambient wallpaper. Our phones exploded with messages from people wanting to know if we were safe. Toward evening, Dennis and I walked the few blocks in a light drizzle to Squirrel Hill’s business district. An impromptu vigil for the 11 dead and six wounded had been organized by students from a local high school. People clogged the main intersection — which had been closed off — as far as the eye could see. Unfortunately, the sound system was faulty, and you could barely hear what was being said. But it didn’t matter. It just felt good to be there with everyone: the families with young children in rain slickers, the 30-somethings trying to restrain their dogs, the university students humped under backpacks. Many held up signs — “Hate & Violence Are Not The Answer,” “Love Thy Neighbor” — and lit candles in the gloaming. The names of those killed were released the following day: Joyce Fienberg, Richard Gottfried, Rose Mallinger, Jerry Rabinowitz, Cecil Rosenthal, David Rosenthal, Bernice Simon, Sylvan Simon, Daniel Stein, Melvin Wax, Irving Younger. Their funerals began a few days later. Hundreds of people attended the ceremonies, which were held among various synagogues and venues over the course of the week. Hundreds more were turned away for lack of space. The usual comfort provided by the rituals seemed, at times, overshadowed by the staggering necessity of burying so many in so short a time. (Jewish tradition requires interment as soon as possible.) The funerals were inescapable. I watched as one temporarily halted traffic in Squirrel Hill, its cortege slowly coiling around the streets toward a cemetery. Scores of mourners followed on foot behind the hearse. Girls from a neighborhood religious school lined the sidewalk as the procession passed, holding one another for support, weeping. People came out of buildings and stood in silence. When the funerals concluded at week’s end, the journalists flew back to Washington and New York and wherever else they came from. The television vans drifted away. The last of the victims’ families finished sitting shiva, the seven-day mourning period following burial, after which they would begin easing back into life in the wake of tragedy. As would the wider community. But how? How to return to normality when so many Pittsburghers felt violated and vulnerable? Clearly, the community’s anguish couldn’t begin to compare with that of the families of the dead and the injured. I wasn’t a member of any of the three affected synagogues; my grief, our grief, was of a different sort, what psychologists refer to as vicarious, or secondhand, trauma that affects the wider population after such violent events. According to Stefanie Small, the director of counseling services at Jewish Family and Community Services of Pittsburgh (JFCS), 10 to 20 percent of the surrounding populace will suffer a diagnosable traumatic response to a mass shooting. In the Squirrel Hill Zip codes alone, that amounted to as many as 5,600 people. “It may be adjacent or vicarious trauma,” she said, “but it’s trauma nonetheless.” Everything had changed. One’s sense of safety — however naive and illusory — was gone forever. No matter that the storefronts in Squirrel Hill now sported posters reading, “STRONGER THAN HATE,” the words nestled alongside a Star of David and two other starlike shapes (a deeply affecting take on the logo of the Pittsburgh Steelers). At times the motto seemed merely aspirational. Not that people weren’t trying to help. JFCS offered drop-in support groups at the Jewish Community Center six days a week. There we could cry, talk to a clinician, have a comforting massage; one woman who wandered in just wanted someone to hold her hand for 10 minutes. I even walked around Squirrel Hill hanging up little crocheted Stars of David that were made by well-wishers from around the world — a project that was the brainchild of two New York women who had created a crafting Facebook group in solidarity with Pittsburgh. Anything to try to heal.  The Falahs — Eihab, Zaid, Fadeeleh, Batla and Rami — arrived in Pittsburgh a few weeks later, in mid-December. (Eva and Naseeb would soon follow.) The community’s unexpected deluge of support began almost immediately. Tsipy Gur, an Israeli expat living in Pittsburgh, knew of the Falahs from an acquaintance back in the Galilee and had been in contact with them before their arrival. She asked a friend, Michael Bernstein, if he had any idea where they could lodge. Michael, in turn, found himself proposing an apartment above the three-car garage at his Squirrel Hill home. Bright and airy, it had enough beds for everyone and a small galley kitchen where Fadeeleh could cook. The Bernsteins had never loaned out a part of their home to strangers, but Michael’s wife, Amy, gave the Falahs a key to the main house, which attached to the apartment. Each morning, the Falahs set out for the dizzying array of preoperative tests at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Amy texted Batla frequently to find out how they were progressing. Her interest was purely professional at first; Amy worked as a nurse at a nearby hospital. But it quickly became more than that, especially when the family began stopping at the main house to talk each time they returned. The Bernsteins’ teenage son, AJ, and daughter, Charly, took to wandering over to the apartment to spend time with the younger Falahs. Before long, Michael and Zaid were yammering away on all manner of subjects late into the night. Amy told me that she soon began urging Fadeeleh and the others to stay in the main house with them. “It was remarkable how fast they felt like so much more to us than just visitors,” she said. Wary of imposing, Fadeeleh demurred. By week’s end, there was no question that Amy would accompany the family when they met with Eihab’s surgeon before the operation. He looked grim. The last brain scan showed the tumor was now significantly larger than what the doctor had seen on the original image sent from Israel. So large, in fact, that it couldn’t be entirely excised. The surgeon said they’d use chemotherapy and radiation on the remaining portion, but in the end, the procedure might just be palliative — not curative. Batla could barely keep from bursting into tears. Not curative? To have traveled all this distance — and not be healed? She glanced at Amy, then at her brother. “I came here to do the operation,” said Eihab, “and I’m going to do the operation. And if there’s something else to do afterwards, I’ll do that, too.” Tsipy drove them all to the hospital on the morning of the surgery. Eihab was in high spirits. “You’ve got my name wrong,” he said after a nurse fastened a plastic identification bracelet around his wrist. “Wrong?” she asked, hastily checking a list of the day’s surgical patients. “You forgot ‘captain.’ I’m Captain Eihab.” Once he was wheeled away for the operation, the family followed Eihab’s progress on an electronic board in the waiting area. Anat Talmy soon joined them, bringing bagels and cream cheese for breakfast. Anat, a software engineer who grew up on a kibbutz in Israel, had never laid eyes on the Falahs until Tsipy introduced them to her a week prior. Since then, she’d already gone out to lunch with them a couple of times, given them a ride to an appointment, dropped by the apartment for a visit and taken Batla for a hike in the woods behind her house. Now here she was, sitting with the family through the long hours of waiting, staying until she had to retrieve her four children from school. “I just wanted to do more to help them get through this terrible experience,” Anat told me. Anat took it upon herself to post an appeal for help on social media to Pittsburgh’s Israeli community — a request that, like Eva’s Facebook post, quickly gained a life of its own. People were soon showering the Falahs with meals, grocery store gift cards, offers of rides, even therapeutic massages. Then they started turning up for visits; Anat had never seen such an avalanche of support from her fellow expats. In the days following the surgery Anat asked another friend of Tsipy’s, Nina Butler, to create a page for Eihab on her website, which assisted mostly Orthodox Jewish families traveling to Pittsburgh for medical treatment. Debbey Altman-Diamant was among those in the community who signed up to cook a dinner. But not just your usual casserole. She researched Druze cuisine, scoured the city for ingredients, then prepared several traditional dishes — all because she thought the Falahs might be missing their food from home. “The people here are amazing,” Fadeeleh texted Eva in Jerusalem. “I don’t understand it. We’re strangers to them.”  After the operation, the Falahs were mostly optimistic. True, Eihab’s head swelled massively and his headaches persisted in all their agonizing intensity — something his doctor found baffling, given that he had removed much of the tumor, along with Eihab’s right eye and part of his cheek. Eihab nonetheless managed to maintain his sense of humor. Annoyed at the nurses checking his cognitive functions by constantly asking him to repeat his particulars, he took to greeting any medical personnel who set foot in his room with, “I’m-Eihab-Falah-twenty-five-years-old-born-on-the-second-of-March-1993-I’m-in-the-hospital-in-Pittsburgh-Pennsylvania.” Then, one afternoon about a week into his recovery, Eihab’s legs suddenly buckled beneath him while he was being helped to his room by Zaid and Eva; he couldn’t will them to move. Eva noticed that the pupil in his remaining eye was so dilated it virtually covered the iris. The doctor rushed Eihab to the intensive care unit and ordered tests. The next day, Amy went along with Eva when she met Eihab’s neurosurgeon to discuss the results. Michael waited with the rest of the family in the lounge; Eva didn’t want to have to translate simultaneously for her parents while trying to concentrate on what the doctor said. He minced no words: Eihab now had a complication — leptomeningeal NUT sinonasal carcinomatosis — of his original cancer, whose cells had permeated his cerebral spinal fluid. Because of its extreme rarity, an effective treatment was unknown. After the neurosurgeon left, Eva sat in silence for a moment. “How am I going to tell my parents?” she asked Amy. Marlene Behrmann Cohen stopped by the hospital a couple of hours later, while the Falahs were still trying to absorb the grievous news. A professor of neuroscience at nearby Carnegie Mellon University — who still spoke, despite decades in North America, with the accent of her native Johannesburg — Marlene had learned of the Falahs through Nina’s website; now, she was a regular visitor. Eva told her the news and asked what the family should do now. “It’s difficult enough for Americans to navigate the medical system,” Marlene replied, hugging her. “Let me try.” Over the next several days via email, Marlene pulled together a group of fellow scientists and medical doctors to thrash out ideas for any possible type of treatment. She waded into the labyrinthine world of clinical trials. She petitioned oncologists and hospital executives and any other authority who would take a phone call — ultimately helping the Falahs secure permission for the experimental use of a particular chemotherapy drug. Eihab was now on a ventilator, one of the Falahs always by his bedside, holding his hand. The rest of the family members were always in the nearby lounge, ringed by a constant stream of visitors and a low babble of Arabic, Hebrew and English. Michael invariably stayed until the last visitor left. Depending on whose turn it was to sleep on the lounge floor, Eva or Batla would inflate an air mattress and make up a bed; either Rami or Naseeb retired to Eihab’s room to spend the night in a recliner. Michael would drive everyone else back to the carriage house. He became wistful, almost tearful, recounting those nights: the sense of friendship, of community, of caring.  I came late to the story of the Falahs and Pittsburgh, having learned of it from Marlene, who is a friend of mine. The more I dug into the saga, the more I couldn’t help wondering: Had all these people who helped the Falahs been working, if only subconsciously, through their own trauma and grief? Not everyone was inclined to make the link between Tree of Life and the Falahs when I asked them. “We’re Israelis,” Anat said. “We’re used to these kinds of attacks.” Debbey, Marlene and Nina — while admitting how deeply the shooting affected them — instead spoke of compassion, and having had an ill family member or friend, as their motivations. Anat, too. And Nina echoed, virtually verbatim, what they all said drew them most strongly to the Falahs: “How could we not fall in love with their kindness, their devotion to one another, their dignity?” All that held true for Michael as well. But he also saw a connection between Tree of Life and the Falahs. He told me that he and AJ had heard the rapid-fire gunshots from their kitchen while eating breakfast. He described feeling raw after that morning. Helpless, too. Giving the Falahs a place to stay, trying to ease their pain, doing something tangible — all, he said, were balm to his post-shooting despair. “It was so comforting,” Michael explained, “to be able to offer them comfort.” There is certainly a tradition in this town — long predating the Tree of Life massacre — of Jews helping other Jews, Jews helping Israelis, Israelis helping other Israelis. And yet, Nina said that in all the years she had being doing this kind of work, she had never witnessed anything like the support and succor showered on the Falahs. Nor had Anat. It seemed possible, to me at least, that something more was at play. Stefanie Small, of Jewish Family and Community Services, agreed. “After a tragedy such as a mass shooting, people are desperate to make any kind of human connection,” she told me. “The warmth that comes from those connections, the feeling of being able to do something good, makes us believe that the world as we knew it hasn’t ended.” Perhaps, mired as we all were in what the FBI’s handout described as the Disillusionment Phase, the profound bond that many members of the community forged with the Falahs provided a way into the next phase — that of Rebuilding and Restoration. And how did the Falahs, in the midst of their anguish, feel about the way they were greeted in Pittsburgh? Astonished, to say the least. At times, overwhelmed by the constant attention. But also grateful. Zaid told me that when they returned to their village, relatives asked how the family could have withstood the ordeal alone. “We never felt alone for one minute,” he replied. “We only felt surrounded by love.” The Falahs were everything the Pittsburgh shooter had railed against on social media: They spoke a different language, ate different foods, practiced a religion other than Christianity. But it was precisely their humanity — the very thing the shooter sought to obliterate — that made so many here want to help them. And in helping the Falahs, they seemed to have helped themselves. In the end, I can’t tell you exactly what role the Tree of Life shooting played in the story of Eihab Falah. What I can tell you is that the two events, coincidentally or not, happened side by side: that a broken community poured its heart into helping a broken family from far away. No one could control what happened at Tree of Life, any more than they could Eihab’s fate. The one thing they could control, the one thing within their power, was to surround the Falah family with love. And that’s precisely what people in Pittsburgh did.  Despite the chemotherapy, despite all efforts to employ every possible cure, Eihab was slowly shutting down. He stopped moving his legs, then gradually ceased to respond when asked to squeeze someone’s hand. His pupil no longer reacted to light. Nearly six weeks into what was supposed to have been a two-week stay, the doctors declared Eihab brain dead. He would have to be taken off the ventilator. Eva and Batla begged for just one more test to determine if any brain activity, anything at all, could be detected; barring that, they begged for more time. It would take days to arrange to transport a coffin home. Fadeeleh couldn’t bear the thought of Eihab’s body sitting in a refrigerator until then. Ultimately, Eihab remained alive for 48 more hours. On the designated morning, the Falahs gathered around Eihab’s bed one last time. They stood in silence as a doctor switched off the machine — silence because, in keeping with the Druze belief in reincarnation, they wanted Eihab’s soul to leave peacefully to help ensure that his reborn self would have a tranquil beginning. Slowly, the line on the monitor that measured his heartbeat went flat. Although Eihab would have his official funeral back in Kofr Smea, Zaid wanted a memorial service in Pittsburgh to honor him among those who had become close to the Falahs. Scores of people attended the ceremony, which took place a few days later. Eihab lay in his coffin in the chapel of a Jewish funeral home, dressed in a tuxedo. Never able to celebrate him as a groom in life, Fadeeleh wished to send her son off looking his best and had dispatched Naseeb and Eva with Michael to buy the most elegant outfit they could find. White flowers — supplied by Marlene and her husband — flanked the coffin, as did poster-size photographs: Eihab in his army uniform, a live snake wrapped around his neck; in sunglasses and backward baseball cap; at Batla’s wedding. As the family entered the chapel from an anteroom, everyone gasped: Batla, Naseeb and Rami wore shirts bearing the now-iconic “Stronger Than Hate” logo. Many of the mourners began to weep. Seth Adelson, the rabbi at Beth Shalom synagogue who had visited the family at the hospital several times, recited a portion of Ecclesiastes — which is also sacred to the Druze — and a traditional Jewish prayer for Eihab’s soul. Michael, Marlene, Anat and Nina all spoke; Zaid gave his eulogy in Hebrew, as Batla’s husband, Khalid, translated into English. When it was Batla’s turn, she read a tribute to Eihab’s life, closing with a riff on Walt Whitman’s “O Captain! My Captain!”: “O Captain, our Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still; My brother does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will; His ship is anchored safe and sound, its voyage closed and done.” The Falahs’ suffering ended up binding members of the community and the family together in ways neither group could have imagined. Anat, Debbey, Marlene and Nina remain intimately connected to the Falahs. All four have visited the family in Israel. The Bernsteins and the Falahs, meanwhile, now consider themselves one clan. Every milestone — Eva’s completion of medical school, Rami’s exemption from the military — is celebrated jointly by way of a WhatsApp family group chat. Before the pandemic, the Bernsteins traveled with their four children to Israel to honor Charly in a naming ceremony, a Jewish life-cycle rite, with Zaid, Fadeeleh and the rest. Then they all went to Jordan on vacation. As Zaid told me, “In the midst of all our sorrow, Eihab’s last gift to his family was Pittsburgh.” It’s a consoling idea. And hearing it, I couldn’t help but think that Eihab Falah had also given Pittsburgh the gift of his family.

Goldstein", "date": "October 14, 2021 at 6:00 a.m. EDT", "body": "How can you tell when you’re really clicking with a person? Is it when you uncover some mutual obsession? Is it when you accidentally-on-purpose brush against their shoulder and your insides go all glittery? I say that the truest sign of a connection is when you have a shared secret. Once you’re conspiring with someone, you know things are getting to another level. By this important and objective metric, you’ll be delighted to find that this week’s match hit it off like few Date Labbers ever do. Because they tried — but ultimately failed — to keep a juicy little secret from me. Henry Balas, 21, is a student with one semester left at George Washington University, and he’s a part-time yoga instructor. His mom is a regular Date Lab reader who recently hired a celebrity matchmaker for herself; Henry followed her lead and applied. He got out of his first relationship “semi-recently” and found he really enjoyed having a partner. He’s looking for a long-term relationship with “someone who doesn’t take life too seriously, is goofy, makes a lot of time for me ... who is also motivated.” We set up Henry with Jack Cronin, 25, a GWU alum who is a consultant specializing in cyber risk. He was in a two-year relationship that ended in December. Then he got inspired when he saw that someone he follows on Instagram had gone on Date Lab. “I’ve always wanted to meet someone not through an app,” he said. But also, he’s enjoying being single. So, while he is looking for something serious, he doesn’t feel pressure to find it right now. He’s seeking a partner with “an excitement for life ... that is ready for that next big adventure [and] appreciates quirky jokes.” When Jack learned he’d been picked for Date Lab, he was “buzzing.” Excitement turned to nerves, just a bit, as the day approached. He spent the night before picking an outfit — a short-sleeve, navy blue button-down “with a graphic design on it ... just like any other gay,” with shorts and white sneakers — and arrived at Calico in Shaw five minutes early. Apply now to Date Lab Henry found out he’d been matched while he was in Minneapolis visiting his mom, who was “over the moon” about the news. (“This is all she wants for me,” he said.) Then he made an important sartorial decision: “I’m going to drop a bag and buy a nice shirt for this date.” He went to Jazzman, a menswear boutique, during a visit to Madison, Wis., and bought a shirt that, he was told, there are only 100 of in the world. “I saw another Date Lab article where both the guys were wearing Asos shirts, and I was like: I can’t let that happen to me.” Henry’s Uber was 10 minutes late, so he in turn was 10 minutes late. “I was, rightfully, apologetic,” he said. His first impression of Jack: “He was taller than me, so that was sick. He was very cute.” “He came up and he was already bouncing,” Jack said of Henry’s arrival. “He came in big. Big energy. ... He’s such a cutie! He looked really good. His outfit was all put-together. He smelled good.” They were already putting their arms around each other during our photo shoot at the start of the evening. Over tater tots, beers and tequila shots, they got into “all these classic first-date questions,” Jack said: family, hometown, education. They found a surprising number of shared interests, from sports (swimming, tennis) to career paths (Henry is also interested in consulting) to deeper experiences. They both have parents who’ve had or currently live with chronic health issues. “We talked about how that had to mature us a lot faster than normal,” said Henry. “That was something that instantly connected with us. ... It’s not every day, especially at GW, that you meet people who are grounded in the world and have experienced true loss and hardship. It felt really good to say that and have someone that was right there with me.” Jack was initially apprehensive about their age gap. “When I found out he was young I was like, Oh, dear God,” he said. “But the more we talked, I was really impressed with his degree of maturity and how we were able to connect on certain things.” And, according to Henry, the chemistry was there. “It was sexy to talk to him,” he said. “It was romantic.” “The conversation was nonstop,” Jack said. Henry’s recollection lines up: “It was super great that he was like, ‘I’m sorry I talk a million miles a minute,’ and I’m like, ‘No, I do!’ ” In fact, they closed down the bar and tried to get a drink at Dacha Beer Garden, but it was closed, so they swapped numbers and followed each other on Instagram, and then ... I asked Henry: Did you kiss? “No,” he said. “Probably if this wasn’t being published, we would’ve kissed.” I asked Jack: Okay, so, did you kiss? “Yes! We kissed! No complaints there.” Then I called Henry back, because I am a serious journalist who checks her facts. He ’fessed up. Jack, Henry explained, “had made a deal with me that he was really nervous about publishing that we kissed, so he told me to tell you the date ended at the restaurant.” But now that Henry knew he had Jack’s blessing, he spilled: “We kissed in the street!” Henry: 5 [out of 5]. Jack: 5. They already went on a second date. Jessica M. Goldstein is a regular contributor to the magazine and the Post’s Style section.

Route 22 meanders through the suburban sprawl of Bel Air, a short commute from Baltimore. Follow a secluded, tree-lined driveway past a spring-fed pond to a clearing. Here you find a steep-gabled house with diamond-pane windows. Except for a weathered marker — placed in 1931 by the Historical Society of Harford County — there is little hint of the stature of the house’s one-time residents as the most revered showbiz family of 19th-century America. Superstars of the stage, Junius Brutus Booth and his son Edwin are mostly forgotten today outside the thespian community. Their home was funded by Junius’s blockbuster career performing Shakespeare’s tragedies, which were all the rage on both sides of the Atlantic in the antebellum era. But missing from the roadside sign is the Booth everyone remembers. That would be John Wilkes — wayward son, Confederacy supporter, and presidential assassin. It is the father, Junius, who first takes center stage at the house, known as Tudor Hall — and it’s well into a tour guide’s presentation that the offspring enter the scene. In fact, the organization that operates the house as a museum is called the Junius B. Booth Society. It educates the public about the patriarch and his talented but troubled brood. A 1940 book about the family was titled “The Mad Booths of Maryland”; in the words of one family acquaintance, they shared “an inherited strain of darkness.” Tom Fink, president of the all-volunteer society, installed the exhibits and runs the museum on a shoestring budget; Harford County, which purchased Tudor Hall in 2006, maintains the grounds. The society supplements its Sunday tours with lectures by visiting speakers, on topics such as “Edwin and John Wilkes Booth: A House Divided,” and “A Long Look Backward: From the Pen of Asia Booth,” about the daughter’s memoirs. It also publishes a newsletter, with articles such as, “Was the Booth Farm Used to Help Runaway Slaves?” Tour guide Judy Savage describes the Booths as “America’s greatest Shakespearean actors.” However, their legacy is today inseparable from white supremacy and slavery. According to Savage, Junius opposed slavery — yet he also bought an enslaved person, Joe Hall (whom he granted freedom after five years). His sons, meanwhile, headed in opposite political directions: Edwin was a staunch abolitionist who voted for Abraham Lincoln, while John Wilkes became a defender of slavery — and, in assassinating President Lincoln, would strike a massive blow against both the Union and the cause of racial equality. In the foyer of Tudor Hall, framed portraits of Junius as Richard III and Edwin as Hamlet greet visitors. Exhibits offer a deeper dive into the nooks and crannies of the family’s history. The walls are decorated with vintage playbills, with P.T. Barnum-era promo hype rendered in ecstatic all-caps and exclamation points. Already famous when he emigrated from England in 1821, Junius Brutus stormed the American theater like a one-man British Invasion. He had a manic intensity that thrilled audiences, including Walt Whitman. He performed visibly under the influence and he broke character to taunt hecklers. “THE MAD TRAGEDIAN HAS COME TO OUR CITY,” warned one headline. Junius settled his family here as an offseason retreat from touring. On the farm, he swore off the bottle and hoed barefoot to immerse himself in nature, according to historians. A vegetarian, he would not allow the killing of animals on his property. John Wilkes gets his fair share of floor space at the museum, which was his boyhood home. It was here that he roamed the woods on horseback and hunted game against his father’s wishes. Because Junius was often on the road and died when John Wilkes was only 14, the rebellious teenager never had much interaction with his father, according to Fink. Instead, John Wilkes’s views on race were influenced by the rich sons of plantation owners that he befriended at boarding schools he attended near Baltimore. After Junius’s death in 1852, it was Edwin who carried the torch into the second half of the 19th century, surpassing the elder Booth in critical acclaim and adulation. Edwin’s acting style became the gold standard for American theater, with entire books on his portrayals of Hamlet. Yet his life was marked by tragedy; he was twice widowed and struggled with alcohol and depression. John Wilkes’s assassination of Lincoln brought Edwin death threats, and forced him to retire from the stage for nearly a year. As an avowed Unionist, he regained public sympathy but never performed in Washington again. The challenge, of course, is how to accurately describe the family’s history as successful actors while not downplaying their connection to slavery, the evil perpetrated by John Wilkes, or the racist context for subsequent celebrations of the assassin by neo-Confederates. Indeed, it isn’t just the memory of the family that is marred by links to the Confederacy — so, too, is the history of the house itself: When Tudor Hall first opened for tourists in the 1920s, it was owned by Ella Mahoney, a Harford County native and former neighbor who venerated the Booths and was also a Lincoln hater. The subject of slavery is part of the house tour — which notes the role Junius played in the slavery system. And Terry Alford, author of “Fortune’s Fool: The Life of John Wilkes Booth,” a 2015 biography, praises the society for seeking to elevate public recognition of Edwin, who opposed slavery. “Historians regard Tom and his group very highly for what they’re trying to do at Tudor Hall, in their efforts to burnish the acting side of the house and to fly the Edwin Booth flag,” Alford told me. “To focus on the non-John members of the family is a good way to go, because they are very colorful characters and compelling people.” As for when the assassin is discussed, the society says it takes a scholarly approach: “We can put [John Wilkes] in the proper context at Tudor Hall because this is where he grew up,” Fink says. “We make sure that no one glorifies John Wilkes.” On a recent Sunday, visitors to Tudor Hall packed a small room to hear a lecture on the poisonous posthumous legacy of John Wilkes in popular culture. Kate Jones, a 19th-century murder researcher, presented an overview that included clips from films, TV shows and video games. When it comes to the family’s theatrical legacy, Fink notes that John Wilkes — despite his box-office power in the 1860s, when he was earning a princely $20,000 a year onstage — was no acting genius on par with Junius and Edwin. He was more of a matinee idol and action hero. Asia Booth also gets her turn in the spotlight on the tour. She vowed, in the dark days after the assassination, to vindicate the family name. In 1866, she published “Booth Memorials,” a biography of Junius. A century and a half later, it’s certainly worthwhile to know more about the Booths’ theatrical accomplishments — but hard to see how those successes could ever be more than a footnote in the family tree.

- The Washington Post", "author": "None", "date": "October 14, 2021 at 7:00 a.m. EDT", "body": "When it comes to cleaning, there’s one room that inspires the most dread. “We’re like, ‘Oh, God, we have to clean the bathroom,' ” says Stephanie Cummings, chief executive of Please Assist Me, a D.C.-area firm that offers home management services to renters. The worst thing you can do, though, is shut the bathroom door and leave the work for another day. “Don’t close your eyes and pretend it doesn’t exist,” Cummings says. The more consistent your bathroom cleaning, the less daunting the task. Ideally, folks should sanitize their bathrooms every day, at least with a daily shower cleaner. For those of us with less-than-ideal cleaning regimens, here are some tips and tricks that experts recommend deploying based on how much time you have. ● Your first step before every clean: “Put everything in its place,” advises Angela Richardson, founder of the nontoxic cleaning product line Pur Home. This includes hair products, makeup, perfume and anything else cluttering your counter. ● Next, choose your tool. For a 10-minute clean, Cummings recommends using disposable wipes that already have a cleaning solution on them. ● Do a quick swipe of your counters with the wipes, Cummings says. In the shower, spot-clean “to get rid of those areas that are going to be problem areas in the future.” ● Save the big toilet cleaning for when you have more time. “Sometimes, just lifting up the lid and using a quick wipe can keep things clean,” Cummings says, adding that your toilet-cleaning schedule also depends on the people you live with and how tidy they are when using the bathroom. ● An extra 20 minutes means you can work with more supplies. Richardson recommends having at least three cloths: one for the shower, one for the sink and another for the toilet, although the last could instead be a brush. “There are different bacteria and fluids in each of those different places, so you don’t want to cross-contaminate as you’re cleaning,” she says. “That defeats the purpose.” Cummings swears by microfiber towels. “A lot of the time, people use brushes or sponges longer than they should,” she says. “Because of that, they’re cleaning with brushes or sponges that might have mildew on them, and you actually might be spreading mold.” Microfiber towels pick up dirt easily and can be thrown in the washing machine after. ● An all-purpose spray suffices for a 30-minute session. If you have a glass-specific cleaner, add it to the mix. ● Cummings recommends spraying down your stainless-steel appliances first. “Stainless steel has a tendency to streak even more than windows, so use that fresh microfiber cloth to take care of your stainless steel, then you can work on your mirrors, counters, sink and shower,” she says. For your shower, she suggests using an uncommon detergent. “Put your kitchen dish soap on a microfiber towel, wipe it down and let it dry. Your tiles will sparkle.” ● In 30 minutes, you’ll also have time to clean your floors. After sweeping, Cummings recommends using Swiffer-like cleaners or steam mops that can “disinfect floors as they clean, because they’re so hot.” They also effectively clean out crevices, she says. ● Don’t forget to take out your trash. “Put the trash by the door so that, on your way out from mopping, you can grab it, and everything is clean,” Richardson says. ● For an hour-long cleaning, most of your time may be spent on the shower, because “that’s where we spend most of our time in the bathroom,” Cummings says. This time around, your cleaning areas should be more targeted. “I’m thinking about tile grout,” she says. ● This is also when stronger chemicals make an appearance, although Richardson urges caution when using bleach-based products, which can create problematic fumes. Overusing cleaning products is another problem. “People are like, ‘I just want to make sure that it’s clean.’ Just do it by the instructions, and I can guarantee you that it’ll be clean,” she says. ● After using the correct amount of bleach-based product on various surfaces, you should leave the room for 20 or 30 minutes, Cummings says. “A lot of times, when people have mildew or mold, they spray it and then immediately start scrubbing. But that doesn’t give the product enough time to actually work,” she says. “So spray everything down really intensively, let it sit, and when you come back, you’ll notice that half the work’s already done for you.” When you return, consider scrubbing your shower with a toothbrush. “It’s really your best friend to get those problem areas,” Cummings says. ● While your cleaning products are marinating, turn to the laundry. “People often forget that you can throw your floor towels and bath mats into the washing machine,” Cummings says. “Most of them will do okay in the washing machine unless you have something really delicate. But wash them on the low cycle and let them air-dry.” ● This is also a good time to organize, Richardson says. “Make sure that the linen closet is neat. Organize perfumes, lotions and anything that’s underneath the sink.” ● After organizing and wiping down all of your surfaces, sweep and mop the floors, empty the trash, and you’re good to go.

As summer clothes and recipes are swapped out for sweaters and soups, it’s the perfect time to make sure your house is ready for the colder weather that awaits. We’ve put together a collection of some of our past stories to help you prepare for winter. How to winterize your home: Winter isn’t just the season for holidays and baked treats; it can also be the time for unwelcome surprises in the form of harsh weather. Don’t be caught off guard when snow, ice and cold air move in. Jeanne Huber put together a list of essential tasks to handle before snow touches the ground that will allow you to worry less about your home and focus instead on what makes the season fun. Here are 9 home maintenance tasks for your October to-do list How to prevent your pipes from freezing: As temperatures drop, the risk of your pipes freezing and bursting increases. Burst pipes are an expensive pain to fix, but there are steps you can take ahead of time to help prevent that from happening, writes Daniel Bortz. Installing water alarms and adding insulation, along with changing some of your habits, are among the suggestions in this story. What to know about space heaters: Space heaters were once considered dangerous and cumbersome, but improvements and added safety features have made them an efficient way to add warmth to spaces without cranking up the whole-house thermostat. You should still be mindful, though, of where you plug one in, and never leave it unattended. Jura Koncius shares tips here on how to maximize the benefits of space heaters while operating them safely. How to cope with power outages: Power outages can be life-threatening events. Be prepared by gathering emergency supplies such as blankets, portable chargers, flashlights, medications and more ahead of time. But what is the best way to stay warm? Is it safe to use gas-burning appliances or a wood fireplace? Megan Buerger spoke with experts earlier this year for answers to these questions and more. What to know about portable power generators: Don’t wait until a storm knocks your power out to purchase and install a generator for your home. Consumer columnist Laura Daily spoke with experts about how to navigate the many options. Here is her story about features to consider, what size generator you need, and other information about purchasing a generator. How to cut heating costs: Utility bills typically spike in the winter as temperatures drop and heating needs increase. Sealing air leaks and improving insulation can help, according to this piece by Susan Straight. She shares tasks you can take on now to ease the strain on your heating system — and wallet — this winter. Do you have questions about home improvement or homeownership?

How often do I need to replace them, and what kind of replacements do I need? Can I do it myself, or do I need a professional? And if I need a pro, what kind? A: Manufacturers typically use the term “smoke alarms” to refer to the kind that blare and “smoke detectors” for ones that both blare and send an alert to a security company or your cellphone. But whatever you call them, they should be replaced every 10 years, according to manufacturers and the National Fire Protection Association, a nonprofit organization funded by the fire-protection industry that provides code language for local building departments and certification programs for people in various safety-related roles. Many smoke alarms now come with sealed lithium-ion batteries designed to last for 10 years, and some building codes are moving toward requiring these in new construction. A 10-year battery eliminates the hassle of waking up in the middle of the night to the incessant chirping of a worn-out battery. It also reinforces the advice to replace alarms every 10 years. Once a 10-year battery fails, the whole device needs to be replaced. When detectors are about that old or older, replace them all at the same time. But if they are just a few years old and one keeps chirping even after you’ve replaced the backup battery or fails to sound when you press the test button, just replace that one. Which replacement model you need depends partly on whether the existing devices are wired independently or are interconnected. If you aren’t sure what you have, press the test button on one. If all devices go off, they are interconnected, typically linked with a red or orange wire to carry a direct current signal in addition to regular alternating current wires for power. If only one sounds, they are wired independently. If you have interconnected alarms, check the specifications to ensure you get a compatible replacement — or replace all the devices in your home with a single model or with ones listed as being mutually compatible. If the package isn’t clear, call the manufacturer’s consumer help line, which you can find on the company’s website. But if you have independently wired detectors, the replacement doesn’t need to match. It just needs to be a wired-in model. How to remove popcorn ceilings — and when to call a pro Consumer Reports magazine, an advertising-free publication that regularly tests alarms, reported in a recent review that although it has found problems with carbon monoxide detectors, it has never found a smoke detector that failed its tests. But there are issues other than reliability to consider before you buy. Modern detectors typically have a specially designed plug, which the industry calls a wiring harness, that links to house wiring. If you stick with the brand you have, the existing mounting bracket and plug will probably work. If you switch, you’ll probably need to install a new mounting bracket (typically included with new devices and easy to set up) and you may need an adapter plug (an extra expense). Beyond that, there are performance issues to consider. One is whether to get a dual-sensing detector, with both a photoelectric eye to quickly detect smoke and an ionization sensor, often called a heat detector, to quickly detect flames. Both types sense both types of fires, but the speed of detection differs. Especially in a bedroom, a dual-sensing detector is best. But if you’ve had problems with false alarms, you might want a photoelectric sensor in the kitchen, an ionization sensor in the garage, the ability to add a voice saying “Fire!” to alert a sleeping child, or a sensor with a strobe light for someone who is hard of hearing. If you have independent sensors and a large multistory house, where interconnected detectors would be especially useful to ensure that everyone hears an alarm triggered in a distant room, you might want to spring for replacement detectors that interconnect via radio signal. They don’t depend on WiFi and will work even if the power is out. Examples include First Alert’s hard-wired smoke alarm with photoelectric sensor ($35.74 on Amazon) and Kidde’s 10-year worry-free hard-wired smoke detector with intelligent wire-free voice ($49.97 at Home Depot). It’s also possible to incorporate “smart” home technology, so you can know something’s wrong even if you’re not home. Short of contracting with a home-security company or installing a DIY version, such as a SimpliSafe security system (simplisafe.com), you can get detectors that link to a cellphone. A wired-in Google Nest combination smoke and carbon monoxide detector is $114.99 on Amazon. There are also workarounds that add smartphone alerts to regular alarms. The Kidde’s RemoteLync smart home monitor ($73.50) also listens for alarms and relays them to a cellphone using WiFi. There are also some basics to consider before buying a replacement detector. It should have a label from a respected testing laboratory, such as UL. Check the manufacture date to ensure you get a replacement that is as fresh as possible. And look for a button that allows you to poke a broom handle at the device to get it to stop making noise when there is a false alarm. Do you need to call in a pro to install new smoke detectors? In most cases, no, unless they are too high to reach from a ladder or stepstool that you feel comfortable using. Get a stepstool or ladder, wear a headlamp if necessary, and grab a screwdriver and possibly wire strippers. Write the date on the back of the new detector. Turn off power to the circuit, and confirm it’s off by checking the LED light; use a noncontact voltage detector if you have an old detector that connects directly to the house wiring. Twist off the detector (look for an arrow showing the direction). If the mounting plate doesn’t work with your new detector, loosen the screws holding it in place just enough to twist off the old plate and install a new one. Retighten the screws. How to protect your home from wildfires Depending on your situation, you can then plug in the new detector, install an adapter plug or use wire nuts to connect the new detector to the house wiring after you first strip excess insulation from the ends of the detector wires. Tuck excess wiring into the ceiling box. Before you twist the new detector into place against the backing plate, remove the tab that would keep the battery from working. Turn the power back on, and test the detector to ensure it’s working. Have a problem in your home? Send questions to localliving@washpost.com.

And that may have you wondering, “What is that smell?” or, “Why do I start coughing when I work in my spare room that was converted into an office?” One possibility: Your home’s indoor air quality (IAQ) could be less than ideal. Mold, radon, pet dander, tobacco smoke and carbon monoxide can negatively affect your health. “We spend most of our time indoors, so that air is just as important as that on the outside,” says Albert Rizzo, a pulmonologist in Newark, Del., and chief medical officer for the American Lung Association. Radon, an odorless, colorless gas, is the second leading cause of lung cancer behind smoking. Carbon monoxide, if left unchecked, can be deadly. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are emitted by building materials and household products, can exacerbate respiratory conditions. Other particulate matter may cause shortness of breath, chest congestion or wheezing. It is also linked to an increased risk of cardiological events, says Jonathan Parsons, a pulmonologist at Ohio State University’s Wexner Medical Center. With all these health hazards potentially lurking, what can homeowners do to make sure the air around them is safe? Mold is an expensive and dangerous problem. Here's how to get ahead of it. If you are buying a home, any IAQ issues, especially radon, will probably be noted during the presale certified home inspection. Beyond that, Parsons doesn’t advise patients to have their home air quality tested without cause. “In my clinical experience, most triggers are detected by reviewing a patient’s medical history,” he says. “Poor air quality is real, but most issues are obvious: pets, a wood-burning stove, mold on a wall, things you can see. If you buy or remodel and find a major mold issue, then obviously you need to take care of it, but a spot of mold in your bathtub or on the carpet is easy to self-manage.” In most cases, the Environmental Protection Agency also doesn’t recommend general home IAQ testing. “Each indoor environment is unique, so there is no one test that can measure all aspects of IAQ in your home,” a spokesperson for the agency wrote in an email. “In addition, no EPA or other federal limits have been set for indoor air quality or most indoor contaminants; therefore, there are no federal standards to compare the results of sampling.” But if you are coughing, short of breath, wheezing or have chronic headaches, you may need to become a detective. “I ask homeowners to keep a daily journal,” says Jay Stake, president of the Indoor Air Quality Association (IAQA). “Do you feel off when you walk into the kitchen, but good in the office? This helps zero in on the problem and may save you money over having a full indoor air-quality assessment.” Rizzo agrees. “Be observant. Is there something or someplace that makes your symptoms worse or better? Ask yourself, ‘What has changed in my home? Is there water damage or new carpet? Have I switched detergents or cleaning products?’ One drastic option: Leave your home for a few weeks and see if your symptoms improve,” he says. Mold can trigger asthma, allergies and other health problems. Here are 6 ways to keep it out of your house. If amateur sleuthing still leaves you stumped, what should your next step be? You’d think it would be simple: Find an indoor air-quality specialist who can diagnose your home from roof to basement, then fix any issues. Unfortunately, though, inspection and/or remediation are not easy one-stop shopping, according to Edwin Bender, vice president of marketing for Broan-NuTone, a company that manufacturers ventilation products. Although there are generalists who may be able to conduct a broad assessment, you’ll probably need a specialist in mold, radon, VOCs or other pollutants to deal with any problems, says Bender, who works with the Indoor Air Hygiene Institute. To find a reputable indoor air-quality specialist, look to organizations such as the IAQA, the American Industrial Hygiene Association or the American Board of Industrial Hygiene (ABIH). Their websites often have a tab labeled “Find A Pro” or “Find Consultants.” Bender also suggests asking local real estate agents for recommendations, because they are probably connected with home inspectors who can suggest a specialist. When you interview a potential IAQ assessor, ask these questions: How long have you been in the industry? Will you be looking at the full spectrum of IAQ issues, or do you have a specific focus? What certifications do you hold? Will you be available for consultation after the report comes in to interpret the results? Will you be available after any work has been done to confirm the problem is really fixed? If mold is the issue, look for someone who has completed industry-approved coursework in mold investigation from the ABIH or the American Council for Accredited Certification (formerly the American Indoor Air Quality Council). Inspectors should work independently of a mold remediation company, and they should tell you whether your problem has a do-it-yourself solution or whether you must hire a professional. “Sometimes, all you need is a visual inspection to find an indicator of moisture or mold, and mitigation can be as simple as cleaning it off,” Stake says. Hiring a pro should be considered if the area of contamination is large or behind a wall, according to the EPA. Because you can’t see, smell or taste radon, it can easily be overlooked, especially by homeowners who have been in their spaces for years. Testing is the only way to know whether you and your family are at risk. Radon test kits can be purchased online or in home improvement stores for less than $20. If you aren’t comfortable using a home test kit and want to find a pro, contact your state radon program. The EPA has a webpage to help you find qualified professionals in your state. How to deal with mold and mildew in the bathroom Don’t panic if radon has been detected. Virtually any home can be fixed by sealing and/or caulking the foundation and having an exhaust system that’s designed to work best for the type of foundation your home has: basement, slab-on-grade, ground-level concrete or crawl space. Want other suggestions? The EPA has a page devoted to indoor air quality and how to improve it. You’re probably wondering how much this is going to cost. There is no definitive answer. “That would be equal to asking what a car repair would cost without diagnosing it first,” Stake says. “Prices vary by locale, the problem, the size of your home and the methodology to remove the contamination or clean it up.” The good news is that, for the most part, there are safe and affordable ways to ensure good indoor air quality. It’s often easy to recognize the problem and take steps to fix it yourself, whether it’s diluting cleaning products, dusting on a regular basis or spot-cleaning mold. Keep the relative humidity in your home between 30 and 50 percent. Install carbon monoxide detectors. Test for radon. Use portable or whole-house air purifiers. Bender suggests turning on the bathroom fan when you’re in the shower or tub and running it for 20 minutes after to reduce the humidity and prevent the growth of mold and bacteria. And when you’re cooking, turn on the exhaust fan to draw out smoke and particulate matter. “Using ventilation devices to bring fresh air in and get bad air out is such an easy thing,” he says. “Look into an air-quality sensor,” he adds. “You can find them for carbon monoxide, humidity, VOCs and particulate matter. These devices make sense, but they can’t do everything.” If you do find a fixable issue — such as mold around a toilet waterline — address it before it grows into a bigger problem.

booster shots has prompted many Americans to seek antibody tests. In most cases, however, getting an antibody test to determine immunity is a fool’s errand, infectious-disease doctors agree. The tests for antibodies, also known as serology tests, do not provide the answers that most people are seeking. Both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration advise against using antibody tests to determine one’s level of immunity against covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. So does the Infectious Disease Society of America, which represents infectious-disease specialists. While some states, including Maryland and South Carolina, are conducting targeted antibody testing for specific purposes, no state is promoting the tests’ use for residents to determine whether they have sufficient immunity or need a booster shot. The tests might indicate the presence or even the level of coronavirus-fighting antibodies in the bloodstream, but scientists don’t yet know what number of antibodies provide protection from covid-19. Antibodies are protein molecules the immune system produces to neutralize viruses or bacteria that have entered the body. Antibody levels do help health-care providers establish whether a patient has immunity against other, more familiar infectious diseases, such as measles and hepatitis A and B. But doctors say our relatively short experience with covid-19 hasn’t yet provided the same information. “Because our journey is so young, we don’t yet know what value means immunity,” said Mary Hopkins, associate program director of the Infectious Disease Fellowship Program at Tufts Medical Center. Testing for coronavirus antibodies has some benefits — especially for determining whether someone with covid-like symptoms had an earlier, undetected covid-19 infection — but not for the reasons many are seeking the tests. “Doctors are ordering antibody tests for people who are worried about waning immunity, but I see that as problematic,” said Alan Wells, medical director of clinical labs at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. “For a normal person, knowing your level eight months later [after their initial vaccine dosages] is of relatively little value.” In general, the more antibodies, the better, Wells said. But even with a low level of antibodies months after exposure or receiving a vaccine, the body can mount a stout defense against the virus by generating new antibodies in response to a fresh infection. “There is more to your immune response than antibody levels,” Wells said. Wells said his hospital, like others, has had a big increase in requests for antibody tests in recent weeks, although he recommends to his colleagues that they use them judiciously. Another problem with coronavirus antibody tests, doctors say, is that they are not standardized, so values associated with antibody tests in one version might not be the same as another. Some states perform antibody testing on a targeted basis. In South Carolina, the Department of Health and Environmental Control conducts sample antibody testing for vaccinated people to correlate antibody levels with episodes of reinfections or breakthrough cases, said Derrek Asberry, a spokesperson for the department. Maryland has done antibody testing on more than 500 nursing home residents and determined that 50 percent of them showed declining antibodies over time. On the basis of those tests, Gov. Larry Hogan (R) ordered boosters for all older Marylanders living in congregate housing. Hopkins said large-scale antibody testing eventually should help to determine what antibody levels would provide coronavirus immunity. “It would be wonderful and important if you could test every month 5,000 patients 60 years and older and find out who gets reinfections or infections for the first time and see if there is a correlation,” she said. “If you found infections and could say those people had antibodies below 200, that would be helpful.” Some antibody tests are able to assign a numerical value to an individual’s antibody levels, although the numbers are not uniform from one manufacturer’s test to another. The level above which a person can be considered to have sufficient immunity is unknown. In Kentucky, the state Senate passed a resolution in September that would have enabled residents to substitute an antibody test for proof of vaccination. The resolution proposed that an individual with antibodies at a level above the 20th percentile of the immunized population should be recognized as having protection equal to that of a fully immunized individual. The measure died when the state House didn’t take it up before the special session ended in September. Doctors interviewed for this story said that without knowing what level of antibodies provides immunity or the parameters — especially the timing — of testing vaccinated people, such a measure may not provide the assurance its sponsors suggested. But Wells added that the idea is not without merit, because higher levels of antibodies do correlate with fewer hospitalizations and deaths. Thomas Denny, chief operating officer at Duke University School of Medicine’s Human Vaccine Institute, however, said the resolution’s demise was probably a positive development. “Given how few labs can do this test and the issues of test validation, it’s good that this bill died,” he wrote in an email. “Also, I would need to go review data in the literature but not sure their stated criteria makes sense.” Antibody testing can determine whether someone has been exposed to coronavirus or has received any of the vaccines used against the virus. Some tests detect antibodies created in either case. Others only detect antibodies that are generated by exposure. Those tests are different from the PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests most often used to determine whether someone has the virus. A PCR test detects genetic material present in the coronavirus. From early in the pandemic, public health agencies and other medical organizations used PCR tests or antigen tests, which detect certain proteins in the virus and are cheaper and faster though less reliable than PCR tests, as the main tool for diagnosing people with the virus. Health-care workers didn’t generally use antibody tests because, as Elitza Theel, an expert in serologic testing at the Mayo Clinic, an academic research center, said, “It takes a good one or two weeks after infection to get a detectable level of antibodies. “You don’t want to rely on an antibody test because you will miss people who are acutely affected.” Hopkins said that antibody tests are useful for patients suspected of having long covid-19, the lingering severe symptoms that affect some people months after their first exposure to the virus. PCR tests only detect the virus in its initial phase, in the first two weeks or so. If someone with covid-19 doesn’t get a PCR test in that time, the best way to determine exposure later is with an antibody test, even months after contact with the virus, Hopkins said. “When I see a patient in my clinic who’s short of breath or has mysterious aches, I give them an antibody test to see if it’s long covid.” Doctors say antibody testing also can be useful in determining whether individuals, especially nursing home residents, developed antibodies after they were vaccinated. If not, they could be considered good candidates for infusion with monoclonal antibodies to mimic antibodies produced by the immune system. Antibody testing also benefits immunocompromised patients, such as those undergoing cancer treatment, Denny said. “We can test those individuals and show their levels are much lower than the general population and give them a boost and test them again and see if their numbers go up,” he said. Still, doctors say, healthy people should be reassured that the human immune system remembers what to do in the face of a new risk. Even as the initial antibodies decline after a coronavirus infection or vaccine, the memory cells store information about the original attack, react to a renewed threat and begin to stimulate the body to resume its defense, including by generating a whole new army of antibodies. People “shouldn’t freak out” if they learn their coronavirus antibodies have declined over time, Theel said. “Memory immunity remains strong. That’s what we need to underscore to the public.” \n—Stateline\n Stateline is an initiative of the Pew Charitable Trusts.

Now that most U.S. adults are vaccinated and children under 12 will probably be eligible soon, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has begun to recommend a booster dose for high-risk adults to supercharge the immune systemâs ability to fight off the coronavirus and protect against its most serious affects. Whether the CDC recommends you get one depends on your age, health, living situation, job, how long ago you were originally vaccinated and which vaccine you received. Not every jurisdiction or health care provider follows CDC recommendations, so some may use different criteria to determine who can get a booster and which one they should get. [Follow the latest coronavirus news updates] If you are not eligible now, you may be soon. So far, the only booster the Food and Drug Administration has authorized for use in the United States is a dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, but an FDA advisory panel has recommended that Moderna and Johnson & Johnson boosters be authorized as well. Much is still to be decided, including whether a booster should be the same type of vaccine a person received originally. For instance, data suggests that Johnson & Johnson recipients may get greater benefit from a booster of Moderna or Pfizer. [What to know about coronavirus booster shots in the U.S.] Boosters are likely to become available to additional groups in the coming months, and we will update this calculator as the CDC announces newly eligible groups.

More than half of the the country is fully vaccinated, according to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Vaccination rates, however, are increasing but remain far below their mid-April peak of 3.3 million doses administered daily, on average. Jump to a state The United States reached President Bidenâs target of getting at least one dose of coronavirus vaccine to 70 percent of adults just about a month after his goal of July 4. When the president set the goal May 4, more than 2 million vaccine doses were being given daily, 56 percent of adults had already received at least one shot, and the target seemed to be in easy reach. Vaccination rates fell to 1 million per day and in July fell further to around a half-million doses per day before turning up again. More than half the states and the District of Columbia have reached the 70 percent target. Many states, particularly in the South and Midwest, are still far from reaching the threshold. Georgia was not included in this analysis due to infrequent reporting to the CDC. Due to reporting adjustments, other states may have weekly negative averages and are not shown in the chart. All adults have been eligible for the vaccine since April, and almost 17 million children, as young as 12, have been eligible for a coronavirus vaccine since May. [For unvaccinated, coronavirus is soaring again] Public health and government leaders said that racial and ethnic equity would be critical in distributing vaccines, but data collection on the race of recipients has been poor. These charts show the percent of the population in each racial or ethnic group that has received a vaccine so far. Alaskan Native and Native American populations have a higher rate of vaccination, which tribal leaders have attributed to their sovereignty and emphasis on prioritizing elders and their communities. The risk of hospitalization and death from covid-19 rises with age, and vaccination rates have followed that pattern, with prioritization for people in nursing homes and for older Americans. [Tracking coronavirus cases, deaths and vaccinations worldwide] The District of Columbia has vaccinated a sizable number of nonresidents as many health-care workers and other essential workers, including teachers and school staff, commute into the District from neighboring states for work.

And each year, hundreds of thousands of visitors fill the park’s trademark buses for tours, hoping for a glimpse of a wolf or a brown bear in the shadow of North America’s highest peak. The road’s 92-mile route winds up, over and around a series of sheer mountain passes before dead-ending at an old mining community at its westernmost point. When it was built, designers made what seemed like a reasonable assumption that worked for nearly a century: the mountainsides supporting the road would be stable. But it turns out that at one of the road’s most precipitous points, a hidden menace was lurking under the surface. And it has woken up. Halfway along the route, as the road curls past the steep cliffs and chutes of Polychrome Pass, park scientists have discovered that a rocky glacier lies underneath it. Warming temperatures are accelerating the glacier’s movement downhill, carrying 300 feet of road bed with it and jeopardizing continued access to some of the park’s key attractions. In August, the slide prompted park managers to close the road just short of the halfway point, forcing lodges on the far side to conduct a costly evacuation and end their summer tourist season early. This week, they announced the closure would continue through the entire summer of 2022. Federal park officials now say they’re analyzing a $53 million plan to bridge the creeping pile of earth, with Congress poised to approve the money. But for at least the next few years, the slow-moving landslide will interfere with one of Denali’s prized tourist sites. And as continued warming destabilizes other key planks in Alaska’s economy and threatens its infrastructure, the state’s elected leaders continue promoting the oil development that is helping to fuel the problem. Alaska ranks as the nation’s fastest-warming state, and it gets roughly one-fourth of its discretionary spending from oil and gas revenue. And as its senior senator, few officials embody this tension more than Republican Lisa Murkowski. In an August Facebook post, Murkowski touted her work to secure federal money to fix the landslide. And less than a week later, her campaign scheduled a political fundraiser at the Anchorage home of the top Alaska executive of oil company ConocoPhillips — the state’s top crude oil producer. Murkowski and the rest of Alaska’s congressional delegation have blasted the Biden administration’s moves to block oil development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and support expanding drilling in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska through ConocoPhillips’ Willow Project. Climate activists in Murkowski’s home state argue that those efforts are incompatible with a recent International Energy Agency report that says there’s no room for new oil fields if the world hopes to reach a “net zero” energy system by 2050 — a target the world must hit to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit). “She’ll say climate change is real and that it’s human-caused,” said Emily Sullivan, an Alaska climate organizer who lives part-time in the Denali area. “But the words are hollow if she continues to pursue new extraction projects.” Questions about climate change? Ask The Post. Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy (R) has questioned the scientific consensus that human-caused emissions are driving global warming. But Murkowski has taken a more moderate approach and accepts that the burning of fossil fuels plays a role. In a phone interview, Murkowski rejected the idea of an inconsistency between her work to address global warming’s impacts on Alaska and her oil company ties, describing the industry as a key player in the transition to a lower-carbon future. “You need to be working with the industry. You need to be working with the private sector. You need to be working with academia. You need to be working with the environmental groups — we all need to be working together,” she said. “Sometimes I think all we want to do is fight and bicker and prove that we can’t get things done.” Alaska’s political leaders have supported some climate-friendly policies. Dunleavy has solicited investments in green energy from companies outside his state, and his administration is studying whether it can leverage state forests to sell carbon credits. Murkowski helped frame major energy legislation approved by Congress last year that puts hundreds of millions of dollars toward wind, solar, tidal and geothermal power, along with carbon capture technology. But critics say that they aren’t moving urgently enough to stave off major climate impacts in the state. One study by University of Alaska Anchorage professors predicts that global warming could cost the state more than $500 million a year over the next few decades, or roughly 1 percent of its gross domestic product. “The only word that accurately describes this is hypocrisy — to say, ‘Human-caused climate change is real and we need to tackle it,’ but then to push for these specific policies that exacerbate it,” said Sullivan, the climate organizer. “It creates a false solution.” Denali’s visitor industry, which park officials say generates more than $600 million a year in local spending, is not the only economic sector being hit by climate change in Alaska. The Trans-Alaska pipeline, which carries nearly 5 percent of the nation’s daily oil production, has been affected by thawing permafrost and flooding, requiring its owners to invest in costly repairs. In a warming Bering Sea, federal scientists are reporting precipitous declines in crab stocks that could cost fishermen tens of millions of dollars in harvests. And in September, Alaska Native groups asked Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo to declare a fisheries disaster given the collapse in the Yukon River’s salmon population — a crucial subsistence harvest for the region that also fuels a small commercial fishery. North Slope oil companies, meanwhile, are engineering projects to include more chilling devices to help insulate the tundra their infrastructure sits on from the effects of climate change. And in response to permafrost thaw, one of Alaska’s largest mines recently spent $19 million on upgrades to its wastewater treatment system. The Denali landslide is one of Alaska’s most visible climate impacts — one that Murkowski, the top Republican on the Senate panel overseeing the National Park Service’s budget, has seen firsthand. “I just kept looking up at that landslide area and down where it passes, and how narrow that road was and how much it had slipped from the year prior,” she said. “And I tell you: I just wanted to get out of there.” Murkowski, along with park officials, stress that risks to tourists are low. And even with the park road closed at Polychrome Pass, visitors can still ride buses halfway into the park and turn around short of the landslide. But it will likely be at least two years before a bridge can be built that will return the park’s busy tourist ecosystem to normalcy. At Denali, park managers say instability at a spot known as Pretty Rocks, has long been a minor nuisance. In that area, the dirt road bed is cut into a shelf on the mountainside. And Denali scientists have discovered that at Pretty Rocks, a 300-foot stretch sits atop what’s called a rock glacier — ice mixed in with a large amount of rocky debris. For decades, the rock glacier slid downhill just a few inches a year, creating small cracks in the road that required only sporadic maintenance. But in recent years, amid record warmth and rainfall, the glacier’s descent has sped up dramatically. During the tourist season, maintenance crews have kept the road level by dumping gravel onto the slide. But the road shuts down for months each winter. And without the added gravel, the glacier has begun carrying the 300-foot shelf multiple feet downhill each offseason — detaching it at both ends from the rest of the road and leaving nearly cliff-steep slopes where it once connected. The road typically stays open to its western end through mid-September. But by August this year, the movement had accelerated to more than a foot per day, forcing park managers to cut off access to Polychrome Pass a month early. At a site visit last month, as rockfall tumbled down into a ditch on the uphill side of the road, park officials wearing hard hats described their maintenance crews’ intense efforts to keep traffic moving before the closure. Just before the decision was made to close the road, dump trucks were delivering dozens of loads of gravel to the site each week, with periodic breaks to allow buses through. (The road is closed to most private vehicle traffic during the summer season.) “It just reached this point where it becomes unsustainable,” said Matt Shaefer, Denali’s top maintenance official. “You’re kind of running on a treadmill, but going backwards.” The closure caused major disruptions to the park’s tourism industry, and, combined with an impending snowstorm, left the lodges at the western end of the road scrambling to evacuate guests. “We informed them during breakfast, and told them they had 45 minutes to go gather their things,” said Simon Hamm, co-owner of the high-end Camp Denali lodge, which evacuated 30 guests. (Their consolation prize: Witnessing a wolf take down a caribou on their drive out.) The road closure cut off the last two weeks of the lodge’s short season, costing it roughly $250,000 in lost business, stranding it with excess supplies and food and sending seasonal workers home early. Those losses rippled out to the regional economy, as the business pays bed taxes to the local borough and buys locally harvested food, like salmon and grains. After less than two months without maintenance this fall, the 300-foot section of road has fallen some 30 feet, according to park managers. They’re working urgently to advance construction of the bridge over the landslide. But it will likely be at least two years before it can open, leaving some Denali tourism businesses facing continuing uncertainty as they recover from a difficult coronavirus pandemic. Hamm is reluctantly considering whether to start bringing in lodge guests by air. Scientists say they expect warming to exacerbate problems along the Denali road, in addition to the Pretty Rocks landslide. Park managers have identified more than 140 “unstable slopes” on the route. And some of those are likely to be affected by the widespread permafrost thaw predicted to happen throughout Denali in the coming decades. “It’s highly likely that we will see mass movement events affecting the road in a very expensive way,” said Louise Farquharson, an Arctic geologist and research professor at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. “This isn’t a one and done.” Sign up for the latest news about climate change, energy and the environment Learn more: How we know global warming is real | How climate change is making parts of the world too hot and humid to survive | The undeniable link between weather disasters and climate change | Humanity’s greatest ally against climate change is the Earth itself Tips: How to cope with your anxiety about climate change | How to stay safe in extreme temperatures | How to protect yourself from wildfire smoke | Thinking of buying an electric vehicle?

{"title": "How to responsibly dispose of your old CDs, DVDs and hard drives - The Washington Post", "author": "Chris Velazco", "date": "October 15, 2021 at 8:00 a.m. EDT", "body": "When we launched our Help Desk a few weeks ago, we asked all of you to let us help you tackle the most pressing technology problems you’re facing right now. And boy, did you ever deliver. Right now, our shared inbox is full of everything from requests for gadget advice to calls for help figuring out some truly finicky issues. And to be clear, we’re not complaining. In fact, we want even more of them. As part of our mission to help you make sense of the tech in your life, we’ll be pulling out some of our favorite submissions every week and sharing our answers right here in a little feature we like to call Ask Help Desk. In this week’s edition, we’re tackling the best ways to recycle your old media collections, how to schedule your emails the way a true friend would and the oldest of tech quandaries: when you should buy a new computer. If you need answers for a tech problem you haven’t able been to crack, don’t be a stranger — you can submit a request right here. We look forward to seeing it! Until then, let’s dive into this week’s questions. Responsible recycling: We have moved all of our digital life to flash drives or the computer. What do I do now with all of the old DVDs, CDs and computer hard drives? How do I remove sensitive personal data and dispose of them in an environmentally correct way if my local government does not take them? — Penny Wheat, Gainesville, Fla. You’re not alone in this struggle, Penny. After I published a piece about recycling and repurposing old tech, the Help Desk inbox was soon full of people wondering how to safely and responsibly dispose of their old hard drives. But since your collection includes loads of discs, too, let’s start with those. CDs and DVDs aren’t just made of plastic — there are super-thin metal layers inside, and that blend of materials means most municipalities won’t let you toss them in your recycling bin. But what you should do with them largely depends on what’s on them. If we’re talking about movies on DVD and albums on CD, you should consider giving them a second life. You could donate them to your local Goodwill for some collector to stumble upon. Some libraries also take donations in the form of CDs and DVDs, though you should double-check before driving down to one — it’s not uncommon for these programs to have been shuttered during the pandemic. If you’re more keen to turn a profit, services like Decluttr will pay you for your old media collections. Here's how to recycle — and repurpose — your old tech But if these are CDs and DVDs you’ve burned, with personal data on them, the situation gets a little trickier. My advice: If you know nothing on those discs is terribly important, you could cut several deep gouges into them and drop them off at a local recycler. Earth911 is one of the best resources I’ve found for finding local businesses and recycling centers that accept e-waste of all kinds — just punch in your Zip code and see what comes up. If those discs contain seriously sensitive information, you may just have to smash them to bits and toss them in the trash. As for hard drives, you have plenty of options, but the first thing is to make sure you don’t need anything that’s stored on them. Once you’re sure — or as close to it as you can be — the next step is to erase them. Windows PCs and Macs both have built-in tools to “format,” or effectively wipe those drives, and tools like ShredIt for Windows can help you more securely erase everything available. But if you want to make absolutely sure no one will get to use that hard drive again, there’s also good ol’ fashioned physical damage. Some people recommend using a power drill to bore holes through the magnetic platter, and that will certainly do the trick, though you run the risk of wearing down your drill bits. (Also, make sure to wear protective eyewear and a mask if you try this.) Smashing a hard drive with a hammer sounds like a little more fun — and maybe even therapeutic — but it can be less effective. You’d have to make sure you’ve destroyed the platter, not just the stuff around it. As for getting rid of these destroyed drives, you have a few options. Earth911 is helpful for this stuff too, and says there are a handful of places you could drop these drives off in your neck of the woods. And if you’d rather stay home, well, that’s fine too. Hard-drive makers like Western Digital offer free programs where you can ship them up to five hard drives at a time to be recycled responsibly. Friendlier forwarding: My dear mother used to send me lots of pertinent newspaper articles to be enjoyed. I’d like to do the same for my friends and relatives. However, I’d like to delay their sending from the 3 a.m. time I read them to a more respectable sounding time like 8 a.m. Can I set delivery times? — Linda Potts, Indiana There are two things I’d like to say right upfront: First, thanks for letting us be a part of a burgeoning family tradition! (I hope a few Post articles find their way into your forwards.) And second, yes, you absolutely can choose when you want your emails to be delivered. If you’re mainly a Gmail user — and I suspect you are, based on your submission — this can be incredibly easy to pull off. To start, draft your news digest as you normally would. Once you’re finished, the next steps will differ slightly depending on the device you’re using. As you can see, this process is a breeze, but things can get a little trickier if you mostly interact with Gmail in other apps. The Mail app built into Apple’s iOS smartphone software, for example, doesn’t have a “send later” feature, and neither does the company’s Mail app for Macs. That said, other popular services that can connect to your Gmail account — like Outlook, which I have grudgingly grown to appreciate — do have a scheduled sending feature. Hope that helps — and do let me know if your hobby of curating news articles somehow spirals into a full-blown newsletter. Substack wants to disrupt reading habits. Will its newsletters upend newspapers? Subscription fatigue: I wish to discontinue an app — Multisaurus — that has a revolving fee. Do I just take it off my phone? — Elizabeth Thomas, Bluemont, Va. It can be very tempting in situations like this to just delete the app in question and move on with your life. Don’t do that — that is, unless you want to be surprised with a bank or credit card charge at some point down the road. I know many people (myself included) who have a few too many unnecessary subscriptions. Thankfully, the companies that created the software that powers your smartphone also built in ways to easily cancel subscriptions connected to software you’ve downloaded from their app stores. Here’s how to make sure you never get charged for an app you don’t need again: To upgrade or not to upgrade: I am a semi-retired designer who has my entire life’s and work’s data on my current MacBook Pro, circa 2013: personal stuff, emails, photos, company files and records, etc. I hear there’s a new version coming out soon — if not out already. I don’t stay up nights reading about these things. But I am thinking it’s about time to replace this one. I want to wait and not be the first one on my block to get one — let them work out the kinks and get some updates under its belt before I get one. Any advice? — Michael Gotwald, D.C. Don’t worry, Michael — I stay up late reading about gadgets enough for the both of us. And for what it’s worth, your new product sense seems pretty well-honed to me: Apple is indeed expected to unveil a set of new laptops during an online launch event next Monday. Reports suggest that these new laptops could come with 14-inch and 16-inch screens. But what’s really interesting about them is that they may use the next generation of Apple’s homegrown “M” series processors. That shouldn’t really affect the way you interact with your photos, emails and records, but because Apple’s chips are designed differently from the Intel processor in your current Mac, it’s possible some older apps you may rely on won’t work as well as they used to. Before you splurge on a new Mac, check out this website whipped up by software developer Abdullah Diaa — it does a pretty good job highlighting which apps have been tuned to run well on Apple’s latest machines. That said, I’m writing to you from one of the first laptops to use Apple-made chips and the only thing that irks me is that Google’s Chrome browser can cause it to lock up for a spell when I try to quit it. (I suspect that wouldn’t be an issue if I paid for more RAM.) You mentioned wanting to wait until the kinks were ironed out, and ultimately, I think that’s exactly the right move here. There’s no harm in waiting to see if Apple’s latest laptops have their own issues to work through, and knowing how this company works, you’ll probably see the first wave of reviews in just a few weeks. Your wait-and-see approach has served you well so far — stick to it!

Adam", "date": "6:00 a.m. EDT", "body": "LONDON — Britain's Prince William is trying to help save the planet by helping inventors save the planet. On Sunday, he is hosting a kind of Oscars awards and broadcast — for an audience into green hydrogen energy, coral reef restoration and using insects in compost toilets. The heir of the heir to the British throne is the founder of the Earthshot Prize, which will give 1 million pounds ($1.4 million) each to innovators whose ideas could help mitigate climate change and address some of Earth’s most pressing environmental problems. Ahead of the inaugural awards ceremony, the Duke of Cambridge has been speaking out on climate, with remarks that, by royal standards, have been a wee bit sharp. Prince William: Let’s focus on saving Earth, not exploring space for new planet to live on He told the BBC there should be more focus on fixing this planet than finding another one to live on. The comments were widely viewed as a swipe at billionaires Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk and Richard Branson, all engaged in the space tourism race — though Bezos has also pledged $1 billion to land and sea conservation and Musk’s money comes largely from his electric car business. (Bezos owns The Washington Post.) Prince William’s answer to the climate crisis has been to use his profile — and money from “founding partners” — to launch the Earthshot, self-billed as the “most prestigious global environment prize in history.” Every year until 2030, five winners will be selected. More than 750 candidates were put forward by a panel of more than 200 experts. Fifteen finalists were shortlisted. They are vying for the prize money, and also grant money and venture capital support to help scale up. Among the boldfaced names judging the final round: nonagenarian British TV naturalist David Attenborough, Jordan’s Queen Rania, actress Cate Blanchett, singer Shakira and basketball giant Yao Ming. Some of the winners will join Prince William when he attends COP26, the upcoming global climate talks in Glasgow, Scotland. Here are a handful of the eye-catching projects: In parts of India, roaming “ironing wallahs” use charcoal-powered irons to press wrinkles out of clothes. There are an estimated 10 million ironing carts that each burn — on average — about 11 pounds of charcoal per day. Vinisha Umashankar, a 14-year-old student from India’s southern Tamil Nadu state, has invented a solar-powered ironing cart to help reduce pollution in cities, including her own. The cart is attached to a bicycle, meaning it’s mobile, and it has solar panels on its roof. It takes about five hours in bright sunshine to fully charge, and vendors can use the iron for six hours a day. She told The Washington Post that the ironing-cart concept could be applied to other street vendors, too. “Soon, there may be solar veg-carts or ice-cream carts, you never know,” she said. She added that teenagers “can definitely be good innovators. We are at an age where we have so much energy and drive. . . . Our youth definitely has the power to do good in this world.” As the oceans rise in the warming world, humans will build sea walls to protect their cities. Already, the built coastal infrastructure — walls, pilings, pontoons, marinas — is greater than the area of all the planet’s mangrove and sea grass forests. Traditional sea walls are mostly barren, as they lack shelter to encourage the biodiversity of a natural environment. But Living Seawalls, a project started by the Sydney Institute of Marine Science, deploys ocean scientists and industrial designers to create “habitat panels,” plates about the size of a large pizza pie that can be screwed onto the sea walls and mimic natural formations, such as rock pools and mangrove roots. Upon these panels, life does grow. The panels are built of “reinforced concrete from 3-D printed molds to form complex habitat geometries,” the developers say. They are available in 10 designs — with names like “kelp holdfast” and “sponge fingers.” The Earthshot judges report early positive results: “Living Seawalls have 36 percent more marine species than flat sea walls after only two years. Eighty-five species now thrive among the panels.” When Ma Jun worked as an investigative journalist for the South China Morning Post, he reported on the impact of air and water pollution created by the booming economy. As an environmental activist, he realized that to fight pollution, you have to measure it and share that information, leading him to found Blue Map. Blue Map is China’s first public environmental database, accessible via smartphone, offering citizens detailed information on emissions and effluents, from 40,000 factories, bolstered by 160,000 air- and water-quality data points, collected each day. Users can employ this “big data” to “name and shame” offending businesses and municipalities — and produce results. “With 10 million downloads, Blue Map’s network of concerned citizens becomes part of the multi-stakeholder initiative that is changing China’s cities,” the Earthshot judges say. “It also teaches the world a lesson — that clever innovation, combined with public participation, is a recipe for progress.” Despite the crucial role that forests play in protecting wildlife and buffering climate change, global tree loss is accelerating. Last year, nearly 7 percent more trees were lost than the year before. The government of Costa Rica, one of the finalists, thinks it has a model that others could use to reverse deforestation. The government pays its farmers not to cut trees. In the 1970s and ’80s, Costa Rica had some of the worst deforestation rates in the world, as locals toppled trees to make way for crops and cattle farming. In 1997, the government took drastic action by introducing a “payments for environmental services” program, which rewards landowners — via direct bank payments — for protecting the forest, reforestation, sustainable forest management and agroforestry. The financial incentives have proved crucial in helping Costa Rica become the first tropical country to not only stop but to reverse deforestation. Olugbenga Olubanjo grew up poor in Nigeria, one of 70 million people in the African nation without reliable electricity. He founded the start-up Reeddi, which provides portable rechargeable battery units to consumers from a vending machine powered by solar panels. Reeddi rents its solar-powered energy capsule, a lithium battery, for $0.50 a day, by cash, mobile phone app or debit card. You take the unit home and are given reward points when you return it. The United Nations reports that there are 600 million people living without access to electricity in Africa. The Earthshot judges think this could be a clean, green, sensible way to bridge the gap. The company says it provides units to over 600 households. If scaled up, with the help of prize money, that number could grow to 12,000 by 2022. Reeddi says its customers use their capsules to power laptops, TVs, fans, lights, radios, phones and, for barbers and beauty salons, hair clippers. Urban sanitation is a growing problem in cities around the world, especially in sprawling city slums that don’t have sewer systems. A Nairobi-based company called Sanergy is helping to clean up cities by converting human waste into products that can be used by farmers. Sanergy builds waterless toilets that don’t need to be connected to a sewer system. Underneath the toilets are blue barrels that, when filled, are removed and taken to a recycling factory. There, it’s time for creepy crawlies to get to work.

EDT", "body": "Tom Farquhar checked the rain gauge on his farm in Ashton, Md., on Sept. 1, when remnants of Hurricane Ida rolled through the Mid-Atlantic. He was shocked — about 2½ inches of rain had fallen between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. Then, almost another inch fell that afternoon. Much to his frustration, the cloudbursts washed away soils before he had a chance to plant a new set of crops. The early September downpours might have been more notable if a surge of rain hadn’t occurred three times in the previous three weeks. Or yet again at the end of September. “I feel as if I’ve seen rain this summer like I’ve never seen it before. When it rained hard, it just rained so hard,” said Farquhar, who grew up in the region. Farquhar is a farmer at Sandy Spring Gardens, a three-acre farm on his and his neighbor’s land about 20 miles north of Washington. So far this year, he and his employees have produced 20,000 pounds of food, which is unloaded at farmers markets, Community Supported Agriculture initiatives, food banks and other local businesses. Overall, Farquhar, as well as other local farmers, said they fared pretty well in this summer’s growing season. The U.S. Department of Agriculture reported that it expects higher-than-normal to potentially record large crop yields in Pennsylvania, Virginia, New York state and Delaware. But getting to those yield levels has been more challenging recently. Now, farmers’ capacity to produce bountiful and healthy crops, particularly specialty crops grown at local scale, also relies heavily on their ability to adapt to the changing climate. In recent years in the Mid-Atlantic region, extreme weather and unusual climate patterns — abnormal rainfall and nighttime heat — have pushed smaller farm-to-table businesses to adapt to newly erratic conditions. Those issues are expected to worsen as the climate continues to warm, driving farmers to adopt more protective measures on their farms and even to change the crops they grow. Extreme weather tormenting the planet will worsen because of global warming, U.N. panel finds “We can expect to have a table food production capacity for decades or centuries to come even with climate change,” Farquhar said. “But we’re going to have to manage more carefully and intentionally to accommodate our farms to the changes that we’re seeing in terms of humidity and in terms of torrential rain.” Certain levels of rainfall can be bad for some crops. As atmospheric moisture increases in a warming climate, rainfall becomes heavier. However, the total amount of rain hasn’t been the most significant trouble recently; the problem has been the irregular pattern of the rain. “If you look at the growing season as a whole, the way in which that rain falls has changed,” said Brad Rippey, a meteorologist at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Over the past few decades, “rainfall patterns during the growing season and other times of the year have been more erratic,” Rippey said. Farquhar said the heavy rain of Sept. 1 came at an important time: while he was changing his crops. He had just pulled his sweet corn but had yet to plant the next crops, leaving bare soil vulnerable to erosion. The rains had a serious impact on the soil and created gullies. “Gullies are a sign [that] topsoil has been removed from the surface of the land,” said Farquhar. “That’s bad because topsoil doesn’t regenerate fast and is created very slowly.” For organic farms like Farquhar’s, the topsoil is loaded with organic material, which is swept away during “gully washer” rains. Sometimes, water carrying topsoil can run downhill toward the Chesapeake Bay, and nutrients from the runoff can pollute the bay and contribute to algal blooms. The lesson learned? Hustle. “Crop transition has to be managed much more intensively to protect against the possibility of torrential rain causing damage to the field,” said Farquhar. Another physical solution is to plant grass mixtures designed to carry water off the field while holding down the soil and keeping the organic materials within the farm. But some grass mixtures won’t always hold up in intense rain events, which are expected to worsen with climate change. Extreme flooding to increase as temperatures rise, study finds At Potomac Vegetable Farms in Vienna, Va., lead farmer Hana Newcomb said a rain event in September — a concentrated four inches — washed away her newly planted spinach. In retrospect, she wouldn’t have planted the vegetable yet had she known the intensity of the rain to come. “Those four inches came so fast that we lost entire pieces of fields that we wouldn’t have normally lost,” said Newcomb, whose farm supplies food to at least 2,000 families a week. “We have a lot of grass planted around there, but it just couldn’t hold the soil. It was just too much water, too fast.” Newcomb remembers picking tomatoes well into October decades ago as a child on her parent’s farm, which she has since taken over. Now, she said, tomato season is much shorter and the crop is riddled with blight, a fungal infection, practically annually. “We just kind of take it for granted now that there’s always going to be a blight,” said Newcomb, who noticed an increase in the past decade. “There’s a time when your tomato plants are just gorgeous, and then instantly they start to die from the bottom up.” One of the main culprits is higher temperatures, specifically at night. Nighttime temperatures are increasing to levels higher than ever seen before in the historical record, Rippey said. For instance, he said, Maryland and Delaware experienced their third warmest overnight conditions on average in the historical record from June to August. With high humidity this summer, the conditions were ripe for fungal growth. The growth begins with fungal spores deposited in the soil, brought in by insects, wind or water from other infected plants. Farquhar explains that the soil can splash onto the lower leaves when it rains and infect the plants. The fungal disease migrates up the tomato vine, and gradually the leaves will die from the ground up over several months. The tomato fruit remain usable but are much smaller. Fungal diseases also affected larger crops. Farquhar said a disease killed the vines of his winter squash, potentially reducing his end-of-season yield by half. Newcomb stopped growing pumpkins in recent years because they often get “mildewy.” The warmer weather does not bring only bad news. With higher temperatures lasting longer into the fall, Newcomb said she can have summer and fall crops in the ground at the same time. With warmer winters, she doesn’t need to protect her crops against the cold as much as previously and worries less about the first frost. Every season except summer is getting shorter, a sign of trouble for people and the environment With more erratic weather, Newcomb combats the varied growing conditions by planting a diverse group of vegetables that can thrive under different weather. She also grows crops that she didn’t used to. “Now we probably grow 50 or 60 different crops, and something is always going well,” Newcomb said. “I think that’s the best way to accommodate the weather. Diversity is your savior.” This year, she also credits a high crop yield to the absence of Mexican bean beetles devouring her crops — the bugs’ absence being a benefit of a warmer summer. Exceptional heat, such as multiple days over 90 degrees, significantly limits the beetle’s reproductive activity and kills eggs and larvae. Given the season’s success, Newcomb and Farquhar shy away from complaining about their situation much. Both know the region is faring well in comparison with parts of the western United States that are dealing with water shortages or severe drought, but they also are acutely aware that their farms are not immune to climate change. California’s ‘Cantaloupe Center’ struggles to reign supreme as drought pummels agriculture across the West “I really don’t complain, but we have to learn to work around the kind of intensity that we’re experiencing,” Newcomb said.

"date": "12:13 p.m. EDT", "body": "A year ago, as Americans were casting their votes for president, the effects of the coronavirus pandemic had shifted attitudes toward greater support for a more robust role for government. Many Democrats believed that could be a long-lasting effect, and President Biden built his domestic agenda in part around the idea that Americans were ready for big and bold. Global pandemics have a history of changing the shape of societies. Working from home is one example. A warming toward government and its role in helping to alleviate the pandemic’s shocks to the well-being of families and businesses appeared to be another. Today there is some evidence that the public’s appetite for more and bigger government, at least in the abstract, is not what it was last year. The evidence comes from new polling from the Gallup organization, which produces an annual survey of attitudes about government, governance and politics. In last year’s survey, 54 percent of Americans said government should do more to solve the country’s problems. In the latest round, conducted during the first half of September, 52 percent said government is trying to do too many things that are better left to businesses and individuals. The current findings are a reversion to the norm. Over the past 29 years of Gallup’s trend on this question, there was only one other time when half the country favored a more active role for government. That came in the immediate aftermath of the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, when the desire for more government was focused on security issues and defending the country from foreign terrorists, rather than on whether to spend more to deal with health and economic issues. Other than that moment and last year, Americans have been wary of too much government. That reality confronts Biden and his party as they press ahead to pass both a bipartisan infrastructure package and a Democrats-only package of social initiatives and climate programs. Like former Democratic presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, Biden faces the twin challenges of asking voters to support more government while also trying to persuade the public that government is capable to doing what these presidents said was needed. Republicans have uniformly stood against more government, and Democrats have been its champions, which adds to the quandary for Biden. As the intraparty debate in Congress over what was initially a $3.5 trillion spending package shows, there is a perceived political necessity to do as much as possible so as not to disappoint his party’s activist core. Democrats will need motivated voters in next year’s midterm elections (and in the Virginia gubernatorial election in a few weeks). If Republicans and Democrats haven’t changed much on the role of government, independents are the weather vanes on this question. In 2019, a bare majority of independents said government was trying to do too much. A year later, in the middle of the pandemic, 56 percent said government should be doing more. Today, those who back a more robust government are down to 38 percent while 57 percent say government is trying to do too much. Independents are a crucial part of the electorate that will help decide whether Democrats hold their majorities in the House and Senate in next year’s midterm elections. They were instrumental in the gains Democrats made in 2018 and in Biden’s election last year. If their current shift in attitude toward government translates into skepticism about the Biden agenda and leadership, Democrats could be in serious trouble next year. Gallup also underscored what has been a long-standing reality: the general distrust toward government. Trust in the government to handle international problems is at an all-time low, at 39 percent. As a cautionary note, this survey was done shortly after the chaotic withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan, which could have negatively affected the findings. Trust in government to handle domestic issues was also at 39 percent, again perhaps a factor of the timing of the survey, which coincided with the surge in covid cases from the delta variant and signs of higher inflation. When looked at in comparison to the average response over more than two decades, trust in government to handle both international and domestic issues looks almost anemic, 20 points lower than average on international issues and 14 points lower on domestic issues. This is part of the backdrop as the president and Democratic leaders in Congress seek consensus on the big spending package. But it is not the entire picture, as administration officials and Democratic advocates of big and bold are quick to note. Another part of that backdrop is evidence that major elements of both the spending and the revenue sides of the big package are broadly popular. That includes child tax credits, universal prekindergarten, expanded child care and family leave as well as higher taxes on corporations and the wealthiest taxpayers. The problem is that to date, the debate has focused on the price tag, not the pieces. Biden, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) haven’t yet found consensus on the exact size or the individual pieces of the package to assure passage. Inside the administration there is a general sense of progress, the belief that, if many issues remain unresolved, all sides are now closer to agreement than they were a few weeks ago, when House  liberals balked and forced Pelosi twice to delay a vote on a bipartisan infrastructure package. That may be accurate, but meanwhile the ongoing public debate continues to flare, as it did last week between Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who is fighting to preserve as much of the $3.5 trillion as possible, and Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.), who has said he favors something around $1.5 trillion. No one takes seriously that either Sanders or Manchin has drawn an uncrossable red line on the size of the package. Meanwhile, Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), the other most prominent holdout next to Manchin, has signaled problems with some of the tax pieces in the package. Ultimately, everyone will have to give ground lest the Biden agenda end up collapsing near the finish line. Still, no one seems to know right now what the magic number will be, nor is it clear just what the combination of programs will be. Democratic leaders have signaled growing urgency on the need to come together. At some point, it will be the president’s call, in consultation with Pelosi and Schumer, to settle on something and persuade all sides to get behind it. He has shown patience or passivity, depending on the perspective, but the time for choosing is not far into the future. Biden and his team built this agenda in the fall of 2020 and the earliest days of this year, at a point when the pandemic was raging and when unmet needs seemed to demand what has been described as a transformative set of programs. The needs are still there, but after Biden sells his own party on the final shape of the package, he will then need to keep selling it to the public. Then he’ll need to show that has delivered results they can feel and not just a number. \n The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.

The progressive left preferred other candidates in the Democratic presidential primary last year, but Biden’s perceived electability — downstream from his political centrism — helped earn him the nomination. As president, though, he’s been very willing to try to enact big changes focused on areas at the forefront of the left’s agenda: more support for parents, addressing climate change, expanding health-care access. Enacting those changes, though, depends on political support. Biden and his allies have expressed understandable frustration at how coverage of Democratic efforts to pass a spending bill have centered on its price tag, but the components of the legislation, intended to accompany the bipartisan infrastructure bill, fluctuate depending on the cost. That’s mostly because the party can’t lose a single vote in the Senate, meaning it can’t lose the vote of either Sen. Joe Manchin (W.Va.) or Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (Ariz.), two of the most moderate Democratic legislators. But it also can’t lose votes in the House, where the margin is only barely more robust. Lose a few representatives — say, ones worried about their reelection chances next November — and suddenly things quickly go south. This is largely why it’s useful to track polling on the 2022 midterms, not just out of curiosity (which is fair enough) but because perceptions of what will happen in the elections will shape what legislators do before then. If Biden becomes deeply unpopular or Democratic support plunges in the generic congressional ballot, a measure of how Americans are likely to vote in House races, you might expect to see more pressure against the Biden/Democratic agenda. In the abstract, things look okay for the party at the moment. FiveThirtyEight’s trend in generic-ballot polling shows the Democrats with a slight lead. They need an advantage in the generic ballot in order to pull even, both because Democratic turnout has been smaller in recent off-year elections and because there’s been a recent advantage for Republicans in the House, allowing them to win more seats with fewer votes. Comparing the current average with where the polling was in 2017, before the Democrats had a massive win in House races, you see that the party’s position is not nearly as robust as it was. On Oct. 15, 2017, Democrats had a seven-point advantage on the generic ballot. Now, the edge is only three points. There’s another important factor to consider: Biden’s approval rating. House races are increasingly correlated to presidential voting, a measure of the nationalization of local races. A Democrat running for reelection in a close race very much wants a popular Democratic president, as surely as she was happy to have an unpopular Republican president four years ago. Presidential approval ratings have long correlated to the results of midterm elections, as data from Gallup shows. If Biden is at 50 percent approval when the midterms roll around, history suggests that the Democrats will lose several dozen seats, giving Republicans control of the House. Gallup’s current approval rating for Biden would have his party losing nearly 50 seats, if it hewed closely to the trend line (which it won’t). As that chart shows, only twice have presidents seen their parties gain seats in midterms. In each case, the president was above 60 percent approval. Biden is not likely to hit 60 percent approval. Over the past decade or so, presidential approval has been largely static, with partisans holding strong opinions and most of the movement occurring with independents. That’s largely been true for Biden, too. His drop in approval, as measured by YouGov in polling conducted for the Economist, has largely been a function of big declines among independents since late May. Overall, his approval rating has fallen 14 points among independents, including 12 points on the economy. At one point he seemed to be buoyed by his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, but since the emergence of the fourth wave of cases in late June, that’s slipped, too. Biden and his party need to hold independents to be successful electorally, and perceptions that independents are rejecting his policy initiatives are likely to carry more weight for his allies than promises that Americans will be wooed by their implementation. Again, that latter argument may be right — that people will see changes in their quality of life that they will attribute to Biden and Democrats. But that’s a tougher sell for a wobbling Democrat than polling showing that independents are souring on Biden’s approach. On Thursday, Gallup released new polling asking an interesting question: Is government doing too much? In 2020, with the pandemic emerging and the Trump administration’s response lacking in many ways, Americans were more likely to say they wanted the government to do more, by a 13-point margin. This year, a majority say the government’s trying to do too much. That position has a nine-point advantage, a flip of 22 points. Among Democrats, the flip was 10 points, and among Republicans, 13. Among independents, the shift was 37 points. Even within Biden’s party, polling from CNN indicates that the further-left part of the caucus isn’t overwhelmingly winning the big-picture debate. Democrats and independents who lean to the party broadly support the specific components of the Democratic bill. But asked whether it’s progressives or moderates who are helping the party more, Democrats were about split. Among independents who lean left, the moderates held a double-digit advantage. None of this means that passing Biden’s full spending bill would hurt the party or that it wouldn’t help. This also does not mean that the party should fret over generic-ballot polling 13 months before the elections; in fact, it shouldn’t. But those advocating for Biden to leverage his mandate to go big on spending need to recognize that the mandate has eroded, and that the large group of independents is skeptical of Biden and the broad strokes of his policy agenda, even if they endorse the specifics. Politics is not rational. If you felt that your job hinged on what you do right now, though, and you see one choice as particularly risky to that end, would that influence your decision-making?

The nonprofit organization paid for a robocall touting a march that afternoon to the U.S. Capitol to “call on Congress to stop the steal.” On Dec. 29, Julie Jenkins Fancelli, daughter of the founder of the Publix grocery store chain, gave the previously undisclosed contribution to RAGA’s nonprofit Rule of Law Defense Fund, or RLDF, records reviewed by The Washington Post show. On the same day, the records show that Fancelli gave $300,000 to Women for America First, the “Stop the Steal” group that obtained a permit for the rally featuring former president Donald Trump. Funding for the events in Washington that day is a focus of the House select committee investigating the violent riot at the U.S. Capitol that followed the rally. The panel is also interested in the role state officials, including attorneys general, played in encouraging people to go to Washington on Jan. 6 and in supporting Trump’s efforts to overturn the election, according to people familiar with the committee’s work. The leaders of Women for America First have been subpoenaed by the committee, as has Caroline Wren, a Republican fundraiser who was listed on that group’s permit as a “VIP ADVISOR.” Both of Fancelli’s donations were arranged by Wren, according to the records and the person with knowledge of the contributions, who like some others interviewed for this story spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. “We have many questions about coordination and funding, and we are actively seeking records and testimony that will answer those questions,” said committee spokesman Tim Mulvey. “Many witnesses are already engaging with the committee, and we expect cooperation to help us get the answers we’re seeking.” The documents sought by the subpoenas sent to rally organizers were due Wednesday. Fancelli, who is not involved in Publix business operations, did not respond to multiple requests seeking comment, and it is unclear if she knew about the robocall ahead of time. In a statement to the Wall Street Journal, which reported in January that Fancelli had given approximately $300,000 to support the rally, she said: “I am a proud conservative and have real concerns associated with election integrity, yet I would never support any violence, particularly the tragic and horrific events that unfolded on January 6th.” Alex Jones, a far-right talk show host and conspiracy theorist who was involved in the Jan. 6 rally, has said that it cost “close to half a million dollars.” He has also said a donor he did not identify paid for 80 percent of the rally. In a statement to The Post, Wren’s lawyer said: “Ms. Wren, in her role as an event planner, assisted many others in providing and arranging for a professionally produced and completely peaceful event at the White House Ellipse with hundreds of thousands of Americans who were in D.C. to lawfully exercise their first amendment rights, a primary pillar of American democracy. Ms. Wren was not present at the United States Capitol or the Capitol Grounds on January 6th.” Before the rally, the robocall showed that the effort to get people to march on the Capitol was backed not just by Trump activists but by a law-and-order organization in the GOP establishment. After the riot, the robocall led to upheaval at RAGA. Then-executive director Adam Piper — who was also president of the RLDF, according to a source familiar with the organizations —  resigned amid a furor. Several corporate donors said they would no longer support the group. Piper was replaced in April by Peter Bisbee, who was executive director of RLDF at the time of the rally. Bisbee’s ascension was followed by more than a half dozen resignations, many in protest, including that of then-finance director Ashley Trenzeluk. Trenzeluk’s resignation letter, which was reported by Alabama Political Reporter, said Bisbee approved the robocall expenditure. Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr stepped down as RAGA chairman after Bisbee was elected executive director, citing disagreements over the direction of the organization. Carr was also among the minority of Republican attorneys general who did not back Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton’s failed effort at the U.S. Supreme Court to challenge Joe Biden’s victory in four states, including Georgia. “This fundamental difference of opinion began with vastly opposite views of the significance of the events of January 6,” Carr wrote in his resignation letter. “The differences have continued as we have tried to restore RAGA’s reputation internally and externally and were reflected once again during the process of choosing our next executive director.” Bisbee declined to comment for this story. A RAGA spokesman, Johnny Koremenos, did not respond to detailed questions about the robocall, including its cost, but said in a statement: “Over the last 10 months, the Republican Attorneys General Association and every Republican AG have repeatedly condemned the violence that took place on January 6. RLDF’s participation in the events was limited to a robocall and those involved with those decisions are no longer with the organization.” Piper did not respond to numerous calls and texts from The Post. “What took place at the Capitol on Wednesday truly sickens me,” he wrote in a Jan. 11 email to RAGA staffers that was obtained by The Post. “It is fully inconsistent with what I have spent my entire career fighting for — the preservation, promotion and protection of freedom and opportunity.” RLDF, a tax-exempt organization, is not required by the Internal Revenue Service to disclose its donors. The nonprofit “promotes the rule of law, federalism, and freedom in a civil society,” according to its website. “I’m calling for the Rule of Law Defense Fund with an important message,” stated the robocall, which was first reported by Documented, a watchdog group that focuses on corporate influence. “The March to Save America is tomorrow in Washington D.C. at the Ellipse in President’s Park between E St. and Constitution Avenue on the south side of the White House, with doors opening at 7 a.m. At 1 p.m., we will march to the Capitol building and call on Congress to stop the steal. We are hoping patriots like you will join us to continue to fight to protect the integrity of our elections. For more information, visit MarchtoSaveAmerica.com. This call is paid for and authorized by the Rule of Law Defense Fund, 202-796-5838.” The voice on the call belonged to an RLDF staffer, according to former RAGA staffers. The website it mentioned was created by right-wing activist Ali Alexander’s “Stop the Steal” team that was urging Congress to object to Biden’s victory, according to a person familiar with the website and records reviewed by The Post. The website identified RAGA as a “coalition sponsor” on the morning of Jan. 3, and then later referred to RLDF as a “participating organization” in the run-up to Jan. 6, according to archived versions of the page that are no longer online. The robocall was also promoted, along with the website, in a text sent out by American Principles Project, a Virginia-based conservative nonprofit. The text, which included a telephone number where callers could hear the RLDF robocall, called on supporters to join the president and Paxton “in DC tomorrow 2 fight for the integrity of our elections!” The Texas attorney general spoke at the rally. Terry Schilling, executive director of the American Principles Project, declined to comment Friday. Paxton did not respond to requests for comment. The Post was not able to determine how many people received the robocall or the text. Fancelli, who goes by the first names Julie and Julia in public records, donated nearly $1 million to a joint account for the Trump campaign and Republican Party in 2019 and 2020, according to Federal Election Commission records. She has been registered as a nonpartisan voter in Polk County, Florida since 2001, public records show. Publix Super Markets has distanced itself from Fancelli, noting in a Jan. 30 tweet that she “is not involved in our business operations, nor does she represent the company in any way.” After the 2020 election, many RAGA members joined with Trump in promoting baseless allegations of massive voter fraud. Seventeen of the 26 GOP attorneys general signed on to a brief asking the Supreme Court to reject the election results from four battleground states won by Biden. After Jan. 6, however, Piper said in a statement that no Republican attorney general had “authorized the staff’s decision” to promote the rally. “Organizationally and individually, we strongly condemn and disavow the events which occurred. Yesterday was a dark day in American history and those involved in the violence and destruction of property must be prosecuted and held accountable.” Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall, who was then the chairman of RLDF, told reporters that decisions to support the rally were made without his knowledge and that he had ordered an internal review. “Every decision Adam made on behalf of RLDF was with the best of intentions and with the organization’s best interests in mind,” Marshall said in a statement at the time. A handful of other Republican attorneys general expressed outraged. “I am shocked and angered by this unauthorized act by a rogue staffer, which I found out about through a press report,” Ohio's Republican attorney general, Dave Yost, said in a Jan. 9 tweet. “It is the opposite of the rule of law and contrary to what I stand for.” RAGA has been a fundraising powerhouse in recent election cycles. But since Jan. 6, the organization’s fundraising prowess has suffered. RAGA raised about $2 million less in the first half of 2021 than the $8.5 million it raised during the same period in 2019, according to IRS records. A person familiar with RAGA funding said those numbers need to be considered in light of the pandemic, and noted that 2019 was an especially expensive year for the organization. Even so, after the group’s role in the events of Jan. 6 was disclosed, several companies vowed to cut off donations, including Facebook and Lyft. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which has supported RAGA substantially in the past, did not donate during the first half of this year. Of the $6.7 million RAGA has received through June 2021, $2.5 million came from the Concord Group, a conservative organization founded in part by Federalist Society co-chairman Leonard Leo, according to published reports. Bisbee previously worked at the Federalist Society.

man during eviction drive, captured on camera, triggers outrage - The Washington Post", "author": "Niha Masih", "date": "9:47 a.m. EDT", "body": "DHALPUR, India — Dozens of armed policemen surrounded the grove as tear gas filled the air. A young man wielding a long stick ran toward the officers. Within seconds, he was shot. The policemen then beat him with sticks before a photographer accompanying the force stomped on his body. The young man’s face slumped to one side. The grisly killing of a villager during a campaign to evict hundreds of Muslim families from government land in India’s Assam — captured on a cellphone video used to identify the perpetrators — sparked national outrage. A former police chief described it as a “horrific crime,” asking for the policemen to be tried for murder. “There was only one man with a bamboo stick in the midst of so many policemen. They could have caught him,” said Ainuddin, the brother of the deceased villager, Maynul Haque. He said he was shocked to see the civilian photographer attack his brother. “Are we not humans?” asked 23-year-old Ainuddin, who goes by one name. An Indian man died after being beaten by police on video. One year later, no one has been held accountable. The incident laid bare seething tensions over the issue of immigration in Assam, a small state in northeastern India that shares a porous border with Bangladesh. In recent days, a drive to free government land from people officials describe as “encroachers” has targeted thousands of Muslim villagers. The violent police action has deepened tensions between the state’s ethnic Assamese and Bengali-descent Muslims, who say they increasingly feel singled out by the government. Many were born in India and have lived here for generations. Days after the incident, Himanta Biswa Sarma, the state chief minister, said “illegal settlers” planned to capture power by encroaching on government land, in a nod to long-held fears of Assamese speakers that the influx of Bengali-speaking migrants is altering the state’s demography and culture. Assam has long been home to anti-immigrant sentiment, toward both Hindu and Muslim migrants from what is now Bangladesh, a response to decades of migration that began in the colonial era. In recent years, the state government sought to identify undocumented migrants by requiring all 33 million residents to provide decades-old documents and proof of relation to their parents for entry into a citizenship registry. The government defines citizens in Assam as those who can provide proof of being in India before March 25, 1971. At the end of the nearly four-year exercise, 1.9 million people were excluded from the registry, though the final result is pending a government-demanded reverification. They remain at risk of becoming stateless. In anticipation of removing those deemed noncitizens when the registry is finalized, a massive detention camp and quasi-judicial tribunals are being set up. The migrant issue has galvanized support for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his party. Critics say the government has capitalized on it to attempt to criminalize and reduce India’s 200 million Muslims to second-class citizens. Amit Shah, Modi’s close aide and the country’s home minister, has referred to such migrants as “termites” whom he vowed to remove from electoral rolls, earning a mention in the U.S. State Department’s human rights report in 2018. Shah has also said there are plans to take the citizenship registry nationwide, deepening concerns among India’s Muslim minority. These apprehensions were born out when the central government introduced a citizenship law that will provide relief to Hindus left out of the Assam registry, establishing a fast-track path to citizenship for members of six minority faiths in neighboring countries. The law excludes Muslims. One of the sites for this contested battle over Modi’s vision for a new India is Assam. Sanjib Baruah, a professor of political studies at Bard College in New York, said Assam is “becoming a frontier” for India’s post-partition citizenship questions. “For decades, the foreigner issue in Assam was playing out independently from the rest of the country,” said Baruah, who has written extensively on the region. “Now, the BJP and Hindu nationalism has appropriated it.” After coming to power in May, the local BJP government passed a law restricting the sale of beef in areas surrounding temples and those predominantly inhabited by Hindus. It also promised to bring in a two-child policy and a law to tackle interfaith marriages based on a conspiracy theory that views them as a tool for conversions. “If I have done something to save my culture, my identity, it is not to target anybody,” said Pijush Hazarika, a minister and a spokesman for the Assam government. He blamed “left-liberals” for indulging in petty politics. Under fire from Hindu nationalist groups, U.S.-based scholars of South Asia worry about academic freedom Assam state is cleaved in two by a mighty, temperamental river called the Brahmaputra, overflows from which have flooded and eroded the ever-shrinking land around it. Many of the state’s most vulnerable populations live on river islands, hemmed in by the river’s tributaries. Dhalpur, the area where the eviction drive turned violent, is part of a 7,000-acre river island. The villagers say they came to settle here decades ago, when the river swallowed up their homes in other parts of the state. The conditions of life on the river islands are severe. Reaching the villages involves two thin riverine crossings on rickety boats and at least an hour’s walk on dirt tracks. Infrastructure and public services are nonexistent. Now the government seeks their homes, temporary bamboo hutments with tin roofs. While encroachment of government land is a widespread issue across Assam, data from the state assembly shows that a majority of the evictions over the past few years have taken place in predominantly Muslim districts. Those swept up in the eviction drives include people who were included in the citizen registry. In India, a debate over population control turns explosive Days before the violence unfolded in late September, police officials evicted nearly 4,000 people from one part of the island. But when they came to evict hundreds of more families, they ran into resistance. Locals said their anger against the drive escalated when the notices to vacate were served at midnight demanding that they leave the next day. When the administration arrived with police, they were met with protests, even as many had bundled together their meager belongings. In a video from the day, the local police official issued a warning: The eviction would continue even if the “world turned upside-down.” Soon after, chaos ensued when policemen began to burn people’s belongings, multiple witnesses recalled. Locals clashed with the police using bamboo sticks and stones, ending in the death of Haque, the 28-year-old laborer, caught on camera. A 12-year-old boy, Sheikh Farid, who had left his home to go to the post office also died. At least three others suffered gunshot wounds. Ten policemen were injured. Sushanta Biswa Sarma, the local police officer at the site, said the police action was in self-defense. “We did our duty,” said Sarma, who is the brother of the state chief minister. “It’s unfortunate. Sometimes, it happens.” The government has vowed to continue evictions and blamed an Islamic group for instigating the violence. The police have arrested three villagers for the violence, including one who was hospitalized with a gunshot wound to his leg. A judicial probe has been ordered into the incident. But for villagers like the family of Haque, this is only the start of another difficult chapter. “We are devastated without him,” Ainuddin said. “His kids are very young. The family is as good as dead without him.” Read more: A crackdown in India on suspected illegal immigrants could leave millions stateless In a corner of India, 2 million risk becoming stateless after release of final citizenship list  India cast millions of Muslims as illegal immigrants.

"1:38 p.m. EDT", "body": "Online, Lhamo led an idyllic life in the videos she posted of harvesting herbs in China’s autonomous southwestern Sichuan province. Offline, the 30-year-old video blogger, who like many Tibetans goes by one name, was struggling to escape her abusive husband despite repeated pleas to the police and courts for help. Ultimately, Lhamo divorced him. But in September 2020, while she was hosting a live stream, he suddenly burst into the frame, doused her in gasoline and set her on fire. She died two weeks later.  On Thursday, a Chinese court found her ex-husband, Tang Lu, guilty of homicide and sentenced him to death for an “extremely cruel” act that had an “extremely bad” social impact, according to state-run broadcaster CCTV. For many in China, it was a wrenching conclusion to a shocking story that — along with a string of similarly disturbing cases last year — highlighted how nationwide laws, courts and police too often fail to protect victims of domestic violence. China passed its first nationwide law explicitly criminalizing domestic violence, both physical and emotional, in 2015. Under China’s divorce laws, abuse was not considered grounds for a divorce until 2001. China wants to stop domestic violence. But the legal system treats it as a lesser crime. Despite these advances, women’s advocates say domestic abuse frequently is still treated as a private family matter, with authorities either reluctant or refusing to get involved. The 2015 anti-domestic abuse law also had some major omissions, such as excluding same-sex couples and cases of sexual violence. In a 2020 report, Beijing Equality, a women’s right group, found that since the law was enacted in 2016, more than 920 women died in a domestic violence incident — three women every five days. With the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, reports of domestic violence rose in China, as they did in countries around the world. Lhamo’s ordeal reflected the everyday violence and systematic indifference many women in China have faced. China seeks to reduce abortions, as Beijing pushes for more children From a poor and remote village, she married Tang when she was young and the couple went on to have two children. Lhamo’s sister, Dolma, told the New York Times she often saw bruises on Lhamo, who periodically fled back to the family home to recover from Tang’s physical abuse. Lhamo finally filed for divorce in March 2020. In retaliation, Tang threatened to kill their two sons, according to news and family reports. Lhamo twice turned to the police for help, but they were reportedly unresponsive. Distraught, she remarried Tang. Two weeks later, Lhamo again reported the ongoing abuse to the police, who, according to Dolma, told her it was her problem as she had chosen to remarry. In May, after Tang choked Lhamo and threatened her with a knife, she sought help from a government agency to protect women’s rights, Dolma told the New York Times. The agency reportedly dismissed Lhamo, saying other women were facing worse. Lhamo once more filed for divorce and fled back to her family. In early June, Tang went looking for her and, when Dolma would not disclose Lhamo’s location, reportedly hit Dolma and broke her jaw, according to the South China Morning Post. Dolma reported the incident to the police, who allegedly questioned and then released Tang. A few weeks later, a court granted Lhamo her divorce — but afforded Tang full custody of their two sons. Lhamo, meanwhile, escaped to the mountains, where she sustained herself picking herbs. Since 2018, she had gained a following on Douyin, China’s version of TikTok, posting videos of her harvesting, cooking, and singing. In mid-September of last year, Lhamo was live-streaming while cooking in her father’s kitchen when a man — Tang — burst in. She shrieked. Soon after, the screen went dark.

Colombian businessman Alex Saab, 49, a Venezuelan envoy, was arrested in Cape Verde in June 2020 when his plane stopped in the African archipelago nation to refuel on the way to Iran. A U.S. Justice Department spokeswoman confirmed Saab had been extradited and will appear in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida on Monday. She said the extradition was conducted “in full compliance” with all relevant Cape Verdean laws and court rulings, and expressed gratitude for the country’s assistance. Venezuela’s main opposition parties recently ended their three-year boycott of elections organized by the government of Maduro, who was internationally condemned for claiming victory in tainted 2018 elections, abandoning one of the main tactics of their long struggle to oust the authoritarian socialist by agreeing to field gubernatorial and mayoral candidates in upcoming races. Opposition leader Juan Guaidó denounced the decision to suspend talks. “Our commitment to do justice and advance an agreement that provides urgent solutions to Venezuelans remains intact and we will not rest until we achieve it,” Guaidó wrote on Twitter. “Every minute that is delayed is counted in lives.” In a statement posted on Twitter, Venezuela accused the United States and Cape Verde of “kidnapping” Saab. “The government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela repudiates this grave violation of human rights against a Venezuelan citizen, invested as a diplomat and representative of our country before the world,” the statement said. Flight tracker FlightAware showed a plane belonging to the U.S. Justice Department leaving the Amilcar Cabral International Airport on the island of Sal at 4:53 p.m. local time on Saturday and landing in Miami at 9:18 p.m.   Venezuelan opposition declares end to boycott, agrees to participate in local and state elections  Hours after Saab’s extradition, Venezuelan security forces reportedly picked up six former oil executives of Houston-based Citgo Petroleum, an oil refiner formerly controlled by the government of Maduro, who have been under house arrest since April. It wasn’t immediately clear whether the men — who were convicted and sentenced last year to lengthy prison terms in a corruption case that the United States says was marred by irregularities — were being returned to jail, or whether the move was connected in any way to Saab’s extradition. A lawyer for the men told the Associated Press that he didn’t know where they were being taken. All six men — acting president and chief executive José Ángel Pereira and vice presidents Tomeu Vadell, Gustavo Cárdenas, Jorge Toledo, Alirio Zambrano and José Luis Zambrano — were born in Venezuela. Five are naturalized U.S. citizens; one is a U.S. permanent resident. The six men were arrested during a business trip to Caracas in November 2017 and charged with money laundering, embezzlement, racketeering and participating in organized crime, allegations they denied. The “Citgo 6” were granted house arrest in December 2019, only to be re-jailed two months later on the same day that President Donald Trump welcomed Guaidó to the White House. They were granted house arrest again in April as a gesture of goodwill toward the Biden administration, the Associated Press reported at the time. American authorities have been targeting Saab for years for his alleged involvement in a scheme to pay bribes to take advantage of Venezuela’s government-controlled exchange rate. The Trump administration sanctioned Saab in 2019 for allegedly orchestrating a vast corruption network that enabled Maduro and his regime to profit from a state-run food program amid widespread hunger in the oil-rich country. Saab has previously denied the charges as “politically motivated.” Anthony Faiola contributed to this report.

Officers reviewed surveillance footage from a Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) train that shows a man board shortly after a woman and sit next to her, according to Upper Darby Township Police Department Superintendent Timothy Bernhardt. The man talked to her, the footage shows, then “gradually” got aggressive, eventually ripping her clothes off and assaulting her. “He sat next to her for a conversation. …” Bernhardt said. “And then he just completely overpowered the woman and forcibly raped her.” A missing Alabama woman was found dead inside a police van. Her family wants answers. Authorities were alerted by a female SEPTA employee, said Andrew Busch, a SEPTA spokesman. An officer from SEPTA’s police department intervened after the train on the Market-Frankford line stopped at 69th Street Transportation Center in Upper Darby. Between 80,000 and 90,000 people per day ride the Market-Frankford line. The assault, he said, took about eight minutes — but onlookers did not help the woman. “If somebody who witnessed this had called 911, it’s possible that we would have been able to intervene even sooner,” Busch said. “Because this had apparently started before the employee who was on board noticed what was going on.” The suspect, Fiston Ngoy, 35, has been charged with several crimes, including rape and aggravated indecent assault, according to court records. He is being held at the Delaware County jail on $180,000 bail. Once Ngoy was arrested, the woman — who has not been publicly identified — was taken to a hospital for treatment. “I spoke with the victim yesterday, and she is an unbelievably strong woman,” Bernhardt, the Upper Darby superintendent, said Saturday. “I can’t say enough about her, how she was able to identify her attacker, tell us what happened. Now she’s working … to get through this.” A protester shot by Kyle Rittenhouse sues Kenosha, Wis., says police deputized ‘vigilantes’ SEPTA’s police officers and several unarmed guards regularly patrol its stations and trains, Busch said. They mainly respond to reports of robberies and thefts. After this sexual assault, he said, the company is considering increasing its security. For Bernhardt, the most “appalling” part of the event was the lack of empathy displayed by the other individuals riding the train. Investigators are going over the surveillance footage, and police received reports of riders recording video or taking pictures while the rape took place. “I’m just speechless,” he said. “To be a victim of a crime like this and be victimized a second time is absolutely horrible.” Bernhardt said there are different steps witnesses can take to intervene. People can call 911, alert the train conductor or scream to distract an attacker. “I don’t know where we are in society that people can’t help other people out in a time of need,” he said. “If you see something horrendous like this horrible incident, you have to do something, you have to intervene. I think that it starts here when we have to definitely go back to some decency, where we help each other out and we look out for each other.” Read more: A Black state trooper spoke out about police brutality.

Fairfax County police arrested Stefan Bieret, 41, of Burke, Va., on Wednesday, and he was arraigned on Thursday. He was being held without bond and is expected back in court next month. Police said the investigation began when the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children was notified of a potentially illicit image uploaded to a Dropbox account and reported the matter to a task force on Internet crimes against children. The owner of the account was found to live in Fairfax County, and county detectives took over the investigation in August. A search warrant on the Dropbox account turned up additional images of child sexual abuse, and subsequent search warrants led detectives to identify the owner of the account as Bieret, officials said. On Wednesday, Fairfax detectives executed a search warrant on Bieret’s home and recovered multiple electronics. Bieret works as a program manager for the sergeant-at-arms, the chief law enforcement and protocol officer for the House of Representatives, responsible for maintaining order in the House side of the U.S. Capitol complex. He is listed as having worked for Congress since 2004, according to Legistorm, a tracking site. Attempts to reach the sergeant-at-arms office were unsuccessful.

Teachers may lack time to supervise such work. It is also feared that teenagers would rebel against such drudgery. Or, possibly, this is just one more sign of our unfortunate national tendency to overlook our children’s potential. A farsighted former history teacher named Will Fitzhugh has been publishing long and deep high school papers for 34 years. His young authors love the work so much that they routinely defy his 5,000-word limit. He has discovered something our schools usually ignore — the powerful effect of going as deep into a topic as you like. Keeping essays to that length, about 20 double-spaced typewritten pages, made sense to Fitzhugh, who was a high school social studies teacher when he started the Concord Review in 1987 to publish these papers. But if students wrote more than that he was fine with it. Because of his willingness to indulge the adolescent urge for something extra, the average paper used by the Concord Review is now 9,000 words. The quarterly journal has so far published 1,427 history papers by high school students (and four middle school students) from 46 states and 43 other countries in 131 issues. The torrent of submissions is so great he can publish only about 5 percent of what he gets. For decades Fitzhugh, now 85, has been receiving excited emails from students such as Jane Chen, whose teacher at Fairview High School in Boulder, Colo., suggested she expand a class project into a Concord Review article. Chen told Fitzhugh it was “a completely new experience for me. . . .  I was free to pursue whatever aspect of my topic that I wanted to whatever extent that I wanted.” What if more high school teachers encouraged dissertations such as Chen’s examination of the light shed on the Pentagon Papers by President Richard Nixon’s telephone transcripts? Perspective: Writing instruction in our schools is terrible. We need to fix it. Long research papers are usually required only by certain parts of the International Baccalaureate and Advanced Placement high school programs and by some private schools. Many of the papers published by Fitzhugh come from students revising and expanding that schoolwork. This year, the IB extended essay program, begun in 1975, produced 88,249 papers. The AP research essay program, begun in 2015, produced 24,021. Both covered many topics besides history. But neither shares Fitzhugh’s fondness for work of any length. To ensure no student gets an unfair advantage, IB limits essays to 4,000 words and AP to 5,000 words. Fitzhugh first got the idea for big papers because he concluded that his students at Concord-Carlisle Regional High School in Concord, Mass., were better than the five-to-seven-page assignments he was giving them. One sophomore handed in a 28-page paper on the nuclear strategic balance between the United States and the Soviet Union. “He was not meeting my standards, but his own,” Fitzhugh recalled. “This gave me a clue that perhaps I was not asking students for all they could do. Two of my colleagues proposed to the administration that they work with two or three volunteer students who wanted to work on a history paper for a year  . . .  for a one-semester independent study credit. This was turned down as elitist.” Fitzhugh had a sabbatical in the 1986-1987 school year. He read a landmark book by reformer Ted Sizer, “Horace’s Compromise: The Dilemma of the American High School.” He realized many educators shared his concern about nonfiction reading, knowledge of history and academic expository writing. “I was 50, feeling I hadn’t done much with my life,” Fitzhugh said. “I admired entrepreneurs, and desktop publishing had just become a possibility.” His father had left him $80,000. He sent a four-page brochure asking for papers from every high school in the United States and Canada, and 1,500 more schools abroad. He taught one more year to pay for his sabbatical and then quit. The next 14 years he worked with no pay and no vacation from his dining room table. The first issue of the Concord Review came out in the fall of 1988. He sent the first four issues free to 1,000 private schools. They were the most likely to require student research. But at the beginning he got almost no response. The project was always short of money. He tried to stretch the occasional grants he received from intrigued billionaires and foundations. Then he discovered a more reliable moneymaker — summer history camps. He charges $3,500 per student for a two-week online research and writing course, including one-on-one student-teacher contact. The fall 2021 issue of the Concord Review has 11 essays, three of them from students abroad. Titles include “Tanzimat Reforms” (19th-century Ottoman Empire, 5,880 words) by Atharv Panditrao at Fremont High School in Sunnyvale, Calif.; “Green Goods Scam” (19th-century United States, 6,884 words) by Michael Benjamin Hoffen, an eighth-grader at Riverdale Country School in the Bronx; “Committees of Correspondence” (6,753 words) by Ruosong Gao at Cranbrook Kingswood School in Bloomfield Hills, Mich.; and “Battle of the Somme” (8,172 words) by Ju Hwan James Kim at the United World College of South East Asia, a K-12 IB school in Singapore. A paper on the Chinese population in Indonesia in the same issue had 13,076 words. AP and IB officials say they admire what Fitzhugh, his authors and their teachers have done. Educators who want to encourage writing have been urging students to submit their work not only to the Concord Review but also  to college undergraduate research journals now open to younger scholars and to publications run by their own high schools. Like Fitzhugh, those teachers understand that seeing your name in print is a powerful incentive. It is admittedly a juvenile obsession, but it got me into journalism and is still keeping me at it. Perspective: Why don’t schools embrace editing? Let’s sneak it in. According to Fitzhugh, experts often say teacher quality is the most important factor in academic achievement, but he thinks challenging academic work inspires the most learning. Students who have tackled demanding tasks “now know they can do it,” he said. “We are not surprised by the breaking of Olympic records by young people inspired by the examples of their peers. Why be surprised if that works in academics too?” Teachers who haven’t tried this could start with a few independent study projects. That can’t be dismissed as elitist if they let anyone do it who wants to try. \n Local newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.) Like PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.

The Washington Post", "author": "Timothy Bella", "date": "5:44 p.m. EDT", "body": "Robert Durst has tested positive for the coronavirus just days after the real estate heir was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of a close friend, his attorney told The Washington Post on Saturday. Durst, 78, was reportedly placed on a ventilator shortly after his Thursday sentencing to life without parole for the 2000 murder of Susan Berman, 55, according to the Los Angeles Times, the first to report the story. Dick DeGuerin, one of Durst’s attorneys, told The Post in a text message that he was notified of his client testing positive for the coronavirus. DeGuerin said he could not say whether Durst was on a ventilator, adding that he was “not able to give out private medical information.” “I’m very concerned about his health,” DeGuerin said. “On Thursday in court, he was having difficulty breathing and speaking. I will have no further information to share publicly.” A spokesman with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department confirmed to The Post that Durst was still being held in its custody as of Saturday. Online records show he’s being held at the USC Medical Center under the watch of the sheriff’s department. The spokesman said the sheriff’s department had no comment on Durst’s coronavirus infection and could not answer questions about his health due to HIPAA privacy rules. Durst, whose life story inspired an HBO documentary that ultimately helped lead to his conviction, has a long history of medical issues. He was in a wheelchair during much of the sentencing hearing, often with catatonic stare as a judge sentenced him for shooting Berman in the back of the head at her home in December 2000. DeGuerin said after the sentencing that Durst planned to appeal. How HBO’s ‘The Jinx’ helped lead to millionaire Robert Durst’s murder conviction Durst was convicted last month in Los Angeles Superior Court of first-degree murder. The verdict came after multiple attempts to prosecute him for crimes spanning nearly four decades. He was not in court for the Sept. 17 verdict because he had been recently exposed to someone with the coronavirus. DeGuerin told NBC News that he believed Durst was vaccinated, but he was not sure whether he received a booster shot. Durst’s health issues are well-documented. In June, he was briefly hospitalized for what Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Mark Windham described as “some incident … involving his health.” The judge later denied DeGuerin’s request to delay the murder trial due to Durst fighting bladder cancer and other issues, the attorney said. Durst’s attorneys also repeatedly sought a mistrial, claiming to the judge that Durst was too sick to testify and defend himself. That effort was also rejected. A physician at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center who previously examined Durst testified that Durst suffered a “mini stroke” during a 2019 court hearing, according to the Times. The same physician testified that Durst was “profoundly malnourished” and at risk of “sudden death” due to elevated levels of potassium. The guilty verdict last month capped a long journey for authorities who sought to prosecute Durst for killings in three states without success. He was never charged in the case of his wife, Kathie McCormack, who was 29 when she disappeared in 1982. She was never found. He was acquitted in Morris Black’s slaying in 2001, even though he admitted to dismembering Black’s body and tossing it out to sea in Galveston, Tex. Durst, who once quipped that he was “the worst fugitive the world has ever met,” became the subject of tabloid and film frenzy that stretched from New York to Los Angeles for decades, even as families of the victims demanded justice. His participation in the HBO documentary series “The Jinx” led to him being captured and confessing to the crime. John Lewin, the Los Angeles County deputy district attorney who prosecuted the case, used the tycoon’s own words from “The Jinx” in his opening statements of the murder trial: “Killed them all, of course.” He was also recorded muttering in a bathroom, “There it is. You’re caught.” The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.

For months, officials at the Federal Reserve and White House have argued that pandemic-era inflation is temporary, or “transitory,” and that prices will simmer back down as the economy has time to heal. The hope was that inflation would have started cooling down by now. But the delta variant of the coronavirus and the persistent supply chain backlogs have kept prices elevated. There is no clear answer for when that will change, leaving Americans to feel the strain in their pocketbooks in the meantime. This is a breakdown of how we got here. Policymakers were encouraged when August prices eased slightly, breaking an eight-month streak of rising or steady inflation. But September reversed course, coming in at 5.4 percent compared to the year before, in large part due to the rapidly spreading delta variant stifling the recovery. Economists caution against drawing too much from one month of data, good or bad. But the overall picture increasingly suggests that inflation is sticking around longer than economic policymakers at the Fed and White House anticipated just a few months ago. Fed Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers last month that the supply-side constraints on the economy have, “in some cases, gotten worse,” adding that \"we need those supply blockages to alleviate, to abate before inflation can come down.” One Fed official is even ditching the word “transitory” altogether, saying it hands the public a false sense of hope that this will pass in a shorter time frame. Meanwhile, the Biden administration announced a 24/7 operation at a key U.S. port this week and is working with major importers to clear a path for cargo ahead of crunch time during the holiday season. Policymakers often argue that price increases are limited to industries like hotels, airlines and cars. But federal data on Wednesday pointed to food and shelter costs rising in September, together contributing to more than half of the monthly increase of all items, when seasonally adjusted. The concerns over soaring home prices and rising rents have economists worried about whether cost increases will last even after the pandemic has mostly passed. The still hot housing market has made it that much more difficult for first-time buyers, or those without cash or solid credit, to buy a home. Meanwhile, rising rents in major metropolitan areas are pushing out more people who are now wondering if they can afford to stay. On top of it all, an energy crisis has ricocheted through the supply chains. According to AAA, the national average for a gallon of gas on Thursday was $3.29, up from $3.17 one month ago, and $2.18 one year ago. Throughout the pandemic, new and used cars have been a kind of litmus test for the country’s supply chain issues and related price hikes. Used cars and trucks have been a driving force behind the surge in inflation this year, up a whopping 52 percent since fall 2019, before the pandemic. The market relies heavily on trade-ins and auto parts, which have been in low supply amid a global microchip shortage. That pinch has made it more expensive for dealers to get any of their models, much less repair them. All of those problems are also hurting the supply of used cars, which depend on trade ins as well as rental car company inventories. Meanwhile, the pandemic triggered a massive rental car shortage after a slew of large companies sold off hundreds of thousands of models that sat idle at the start of the pandemic as Americans stopped traveling. Back in May of this year, more than one of every three rental cars that had been in service before the pandemic was no longer available. However, as more people got vaccinated and started itching for spring and summer trips, customer demand boomed. Companies could not get their hands on cars fast enough, driving up prices while people scrambled for reservations and companies rushed to restock lots. New cars are now also seeing rising prices thanks to the ongoing microchip shortage. Pandemic-related shutdowns have pinched factories around the world. For instance, auto production in North America has been slowed by shutdowns in countries like Malaysia and Vietnam. Families across the nation are also facing higher prices at the grocery store, which have people stretching their wallets for dairy, fruits and vegetables, baked goods and meats. Prices for meat, poultry, fish and eggs have surged in particular above other grocery categories. The White House has pointed to broad consolidation in the meat industry, saying that large companies bear some of the responsibility for pushing prices higher. Meat industry groups disagree, arguing that the same supply-side issues rampant in the rest of the economy apply to proteins because it costs more to transport and package materials, while labor shortages have held back meat production. Meanwhile, food categories with less of a surge are still seeing prices tick up while supply chains lag. The September consumer price index showed apples up 3.8 percent compared to August. Peanut butter was up 3.0 percent, and potatoes were up 2.4 percent. Looming in the background is another major challenge for policymakers, which is how to keep inflation expectations in check. There is an inherent psychological aspect to inflation: If consumers or businesses expect the cost of goods and services to keep rising, they may change their behavior now. For instance, vacationers might rush to book hotel rooms now. Or businesses may stock up on advance orders, pushing prices higher and making those very expectations self-fulfilling events. Fed leaders say they are not worried and would respond if they started to see concerning signs bubble up. But some measures suggest anxiety is high. One survey of consumer inflation expectations tracked by the New York Fed hit a record high in September. Consumer confidence took a tumble in August as the delta variant spread across the country, according to a closely tracked survey which is run by the University of Michigan. “There is little doubt that the pandemic’s resurgence due to the delta variant has been met with a mixture of reason and emotion,” the survey results said.

Miller", "date": "October 14, 2021 at 7:00 a.m. EDT", "body": " In discussing the surge of workers quitting or retiring during the coronavirus pandemic, one question that I keep hearing, and that I asked last week, is: How are people who abruptly quit or retired from their jobs getting by financially? Most of the departing workers I heard from had also asked themselves that question, but they had decided that they could more easily give up their paychecks than their well-being. A record number of workers are quitting their jobs, empowered by new leverage Some retirees said that although the pandemic nudged them into retirement faster than they expected, it also brought relief from the expenses incurred in pursuing their careers. “I [no longer] need to buy clothes or shoes for work, fill the gas tank three times a week, pay for parking, etc.,” wrote Sandy Marasco in an email. After being laid off from her pharmaceutical industry job in Cambridge, Mass., early during the pandemic, Marasco used her severance package to pay off her mortgage. She then lived off her savings and state unemployment benefits through 18 months of unsuccessful job-searching before realizing that her earlier goal of working full-time until age 70 no longer appealed to her. Marasco now gets by on Social Security and a 401(k) retirement plan. Kathleen Corcoran had concerns about giving up the “golden handcuffs” of a full-time job in the high-cost D.C. metro area when she retired from her communications career. But no full-time salary could allow her to buy what she really wanted: time. Giving up income is stressful, but “then you realize some of that money is going for things to de-stress you” from work, Corcoran told me in a phone interview. “Once I sat down and looked at the numbers, I realized [retiring] was doable — and what I was getting in return was time to pursue things I really wanted to pursue,” such as seeing friends, writing, reading and volunteering. She now teaches part-time, a job she finds “rewarding in a way that goes beyond a paycheck.” America’s unemployed are sending a message: They’ll go back to work when they feel safe – and well-compensated A former office manager in Laurel, Md., who withheld her name because of tension with her former boss, has no regrets about retiring early, even though it meant getting less in Social Security: “If I had waited until 70, I would have received $300 more per month.” But, she said, she weighed her sanity against that financial loss and “decided to take the leap. I’m so happy that I did.” Of course, retirement is still a long way off for many people. Some have been reassessing what they want from their jobs versus what they need. Jason S. of New York City, who asked for partial anonymity out of respect for relatives in government who share his surname, was laid off from one contract position and terminated from the next after he had protested being called into the office for a job he’d been told would be 100 percent remote. During the ‘Great Resignation,’ workers refuse to accept the unacceptable Although his wife works and they have six months of savings, Jason’s being out of work is taking a big bite out of their finances,  “so this is not sustainable even in the medium term,” he told me in an email. His job-search priorities are shifting: “Taking a lesser-paying job with health insurance over a no-benefits [contract job] would be a no-brainer for me now.” And some people have been able to weather income loss thanks to careers that conditioned them to prepare for the worst. Marlen Garcia, of Chicago, told me via email how at age 26 she was denied a $5,000 raise with her promotion at a newspaper because of company pay policy, and how she saw other journalists lose jobs and opportunities “on the whims of bosses.” FAQ: Why is everyone quitting, and how do I know whether it’s time to leave my job? Garcia told her husband, “We have to be in a position where I can leave my job one day if that happens to me.” They bought a small house and “ate a lot of bologna” so they could afford to pay extra toward the principal each month. When the mortgage was paid off 16 years later, it allowed Garcia the flexibility to take freelance and part-time work when full-time jobs were unavailable. One common theme among the people who shared their stories with me: They don’t take their relative fortune for granted. “I have been very lucky and am thankful for that,” Marasco wrote. “I also do what I can for those less fortunate.” Marasco opted not to collect the federal government’s expanded pandemic unemployment benefits. Garcia recognizes that luck and the economy were important in shoring up her finances. “I had less than $5,000 in loans when I finished college in 1993. [Graduates today] have tens of thousands of dollars in debt. Rents are crazy. Too many homes are unaffordable. I don’t see how they can do it.” Pandemic jobless benefits are gone. Where does that leave many Americans? Even before the pandemic, rising costs of living — rather, costs of surviving — have left most low- and middle-income workers unable to build a sizable savings cushion or anchor themselves with real estate and other investments. For those with student loans, medical debt and dependents, the footing was already treacherous. Enter the pandemic, and the ground is crumbling. I know for every success story I heard, there are many more invisible struggles — people with no pensions, partners or pandemic relief to help them get by. I can only assume they’re consumed with making ends meet. Reader query: Employers everywhere are saying it’s impossible to find workers. Job seekers are telling me no one’s responding to their applications — or the work and pay are different from what was advertised. What’s your experience?

As a teenager, she struggled with addiction, danced as a stripper and tried to overdose on pills. Her ticket to a better life was learning to code. Last year, she became perhaps the least probable member of Apple’s elite software engineering corps. But the storied tech giant, Scarlett says, turned out to be a place that blithely enables discrimination against women and other historically underrepresented groups, including disabled people. So, despite her plush new salary and a newfound sense of financial security, Scarlett, 36, says she decided to speak out, becoming one of a tiny number out of tens of thousands of Apple employees to publicly criticize the company. “Apple does not care about its employees. It cares about money,” Scarlett said in an interview. “Maybe that’s capitalism, and that’s just the way corporations are. But I can’t live my life further accepting it and not saying something about it.” Apple declined to comment on her specific allegations or specific employee matters, and said it is committed to a positive and inclusive workplace. Get the day’s most important and interesting stories in a brief text message. Scarlett’s story as told to The Washington Post is part of a growing chorus of tech workers — many of them women — challenging the power centers of Silicon Valley, where some of them allege companies are still run like frat houses and discrimination against women and racial minorities continues to make headlines. In recent years, more than 20,000 Google employees staged a walkout to protest sexual misconduct and inequality, while Black women at Pinterest accused the company of discrimination and retaliation. Just last month, Amazon settled a wrongful termination suit against two women it fired after they publicly criticized the company’s climate policies. Last Tuesday, former Facebook employee Frances Haugen became the highest profile tech whistleblower of all when she testified before Congress that Facebook misled the public about the harm caused by its products. “This is an industry with a pronounced racism and misogyny problem,” said Meredith Whittaker, a former Google employee who helped lead the walkout there. Whittaker, as well as Timnit Gebru, who was fired from Google after she raised questions about the ethics of its artificial intelligence ambitions, has spoken with Scarlett about her efforts. Gebru said the way the tech industry is covered by the media, which to her deifies tech leaders, helps shield tech companies from scrutiny. “There’s just no accountability,” she said. The activists have chalked up some victories. In January, Google employees formed a union, a rarity in an industry that generally pays well and rewards employees with stock options worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. Meanwhile, California courts had begun whittling away at the power of nondisclosure agreements, an essential element of a top secret culture that publicly punishes dissenters. Large companies, though, still have the upper hand. Most tech employees fear speaking about the companies they work for, lest they be discovered by myriad corporate surveillance techniques that have only gotten more sophisticated with new technology. Nowhere is that more true than at Apple, whose CEO Tim Cook, in the wake of employees speaking out about working conditions, sent a companywide memo about the company’s efforts to ferret out leakers. That began to change this summer, with the rise of the #AppleToo movement. In largely anonymous testimonials, more than 500 employees — many working at Apple’s more than 500 global retail stores — have accused the company of erecting “an opaque, intimidating fortress” that tolerates “racism, sexism, discrimination, retaliation, bullying, sexual and other forms of harassment.” Scarlett has become the face of the #AppleToo movement, a role that evolved from her brutally honest presence on Twitter, where she goes by @cherthedev and has amassed 46,000 followers. On Twitter, Scarlett has openly discussed the messy details of her life, and her feisty presence on the platform has quickly made her a magnet for Apple colleagues having difficulties with the company. She took to Twitter to encourage women to come forward with stories of sexual harassment at her former employer, Activision Blizzard, and called out an alleged pay gap at Starbucks. “I began to recognize this power of this platform that I have,” she said. Scarlett, who says her mental health has suffered as a result of the harassment she has received from some of her colleagues at Apple, is now on paid medical leave and has retained an attorney who is representing her in negotiations with Apple’s lawyers. “I’m not a corporate shill, but I’m also not throw-away-my-job idiotic,’” she said. “I have to feel good about what I’m putting into the world, whether that’s in my job or on social media, whatever. I have to feel good about it. And if I don’t, I have to remedy it immediately.” “We are and have always been deeply committed to creating and maintaining a positive and inclusive workplace. We take all concerns seriously and we thoroughly investigate whenever a concern is raised and, out of respect for the privacy of any individuals involved, we do not discuss specific employee matters,” said Apple spokesman Josh Rosenstock in a statement. Scarlett has support from some of her colleagues, most of whom she says will not speak to reporters, for fear of harming their careers. “She’s doing it because she believes in doing the right thing for people and making sure the company we work for is doing the right thing,” said Janneke Parrish, a program manager on the Apple Maps team who has helped organize the #Appletoo initiative. Parrish has talked to Scarlett about her troubled past and how it drives her desire to fight what she sees as injustice. “It is an incredible story,” Parrish said. “She’s a deeply inspiring figure.” In a series of interviews with The Post, Scarlett described growing up in Kirkland Wash., and being a junior astronaut who wanted to become a scientist and go to space. An avid gamer who created a website for her “guild” in the role playing game Everquest, Scarlett says she studied for the SAT and got a near perfect score. But her family was poor, she said. Her mother worked for a construction company and her father and stepfather came in and out of her life, she said. Though her memory is fuzzy, she said she was sexually abused as a young child by a family friend. In high school, she began experimenting with drugs and began stripping at 18 to pay for a cocaine habit. Scarlett says she was forced to perform sex acts on camera at 19. Days later, she says she attempted suicide. She provided information to federal investigators in 2018, which led to the arrest of the perpetrator, and began going by Scarlett, which is not her real name, out of concern for her safety. She is in the process of legally changing it. She got pregnant at 21, and the decision to have the baby forced her to clean up her act, she says. In 2007, she was pregnant and living in Kirkland, Wash., when she noticed an ad for a web developer position at Luxuryrealestate.com in Seattle. Scarlett had taught herself how to code and dabbled in web development on an early blogging platform called LiveJournal, she says. She could only afford a dial-up connection, so she built the journals and other websites from scratch with more efficient code, instead of using slow, balky programs like Adobe Flash. “It wasn’t even on purpose,” she recalls. “It was like I can’t use websites. They take too long to load.” So Scarlett built a website specifically for the real estate position, calling herself a “front end developer,” a term that describes someone who specializes in the code that powers how websites look. She got the job and soon gave birth to a daughter, Lexi, whom she is raising as a single mother in Kirkland today. Later that year, she quit to freelance, tumbling back into making self-destructive decisions. In 2009, she said she tried heroin for the first time and began passing bad checks. She says she never got caught, but is still in debt from financial decisions she made at the time. She spent two years in this fog before pulling herself out of the spiral and starting to freelance again. Then, one day in 2011, a recruiter from USA Today reached out about a web development opening. The company flew her to Tysons Corner in Virginia for an interview and put her up in a hotel, where she was asked to show a credit card or put down a $100 deposit. She had $23 in her pocket. The hotel let her check in, but only after emptying the minibar, she said. She got the job, along with a five-figure signing bonus — an experience she described as surreal. “How do you just all of a sudden have the thing you need?” she said. “It felt very dissociated and detached from reality, like in someone else’s life.” In 2015, Scarlett was recruited by Activision-Blizzard, maker of the hugely popular game “Call of Duty,” to work at the company’s Los Angeles offices. Last month, the company confirmed that it is under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for its handling of allegations of sexual harassment and gender-based discrimination. At Activision Blizzard, Scarlett said the reality of being a woman in an industry dominated by men began to sink in. In 2016, she said she went to human resources to ask why men doing similar work at the company received higher salaries and signing bonuses while she did not, she says. Nothing happened. “I was starting to know my value, what I bring to a company,” she said. “I was kind of starting to put together this puzzle that I don’t think at the time I necessarily realized I was putting together, but I really was finding myself.” Jesiah McCann, Scarlett’s manager at USA Today, said she was a talented developer. Chris Giroir, Scarlett’s manager at Activision Blizzard, called Scarlett an “incredibly driven” employee and a great colleague who “shows passion with every project she works on and she doesn’t stop until she gets it right.” Scarlett went on to work at World Wide Technology, a technology services provider based in St. Louis, then became a lead software engineer at Starbucks, where she joined a successful campaign to address a long-standing gender pay gap. For the first time, Scarlett also began going to therapy, she said. Since she was a kid, various psychiatrists and psychologists had diagnosed her with bipolar disorder, but she did not believe the diagnoses. Now, she began addressing it and learning how to cope with it. When Scarlett left Starbucks, she wrote a blog post criticizing the company for paying lower salaries to workers in geographies with predominantly Black and underrepresented groups. It was then that she began to build an online reputation as an activist for workers rights. In 2019, she left Starbucks for Webflow, a website design company, and wrote a Medium post advocating better pay equity for underrepresented groups. In November that same year, Scarlett connected on Twitter with Devon Lindsey, an engineer at Apple, who said Scarlett was underpaid and wanted to help find her a position at Apple. Lindsey followed through in February, recommending Scarlett for a job on the Apple security team, which builds software products for internal use at the company. Lindsey declined to comment. The job offered a $170,000 salary — $23,000 more than Scarlett was then making — and the promise of $128,000 in Apple stock over four years. There was also a $10,000 signing bonus. When Scarlett got the job, she said, she cried. “It was just so unreal to me,” she said. “I could actually see myself paying off all this debt and being able to retire someday.” Because she was hired during the pandemic, Scarlett never visited the Apple campus in Cupertino, Calif. Still, she liked her manager and her team. For the first year, she said, everything about Apple was “smooth sailing.” “It just felt really good. The team was supportive,” she said, even when she had to take an occasional mental health break. Then some time around 2020 Apple hired Antonio Garcia Martinez, a former Facebook advertising executive who had written a best-selling memoir, “Chaos Monkeys: Obscene Fortune and Random Failure in Silicon Valley.” In the book, Martinez referred to women in the Bay Area as “soft and weak, cosseted and naive.” Apple, a company that devotes considerable marketing effort to branding itself as a leader in diversity and inclusion, faced internal and external criticism for hiring someone who appeared to conflict with its stated corporate values. Several employees reached out to Scarlett for guidance on how to respond to the hire. Scarlett says she raised the issue with human resources, but did not hear back immediately. She ended up helping write a letter condemning the hire. She said she told the authors of the letter to be more assertive. “This man just wrote that we’re weak and cosseted,” she recalls saying. “So let’s not be.” Scarlett said she crossed out a series of “wants” and made them “demands,” and alerted her manager that the letter was coming. She heard nothing back, she said. So on May 12, she turned to Twitter. “I have been gutted, as many other folks at Apple were, with the hiring of Antonio Garcia Martinez,” Scarlett wrote. “I believe in the strength of community we have at Apple, & that the culture we’ve built can weather this. I also believe in leadership to do the right thing, whatever that is.” When the post drew media attention, Scarlett said her managers got in touch, as did Apple’s communications department. But they seemed more interested in tamping down bad publicity than in addressing the concerns of Scarlett and other employees, she said. Garcia Martinez left the company days after the uproar over his hiring. “At Apple, we have always strived to create an inclusive, welcoming workplace where everyone is respected and accepted. Behavior that demeans or discriminates against people for who they are has no place here,” a company statement said at the time. Martinez declined to comment. Recognizing the power of Scarlett’s platform, she said colleagues began asking her to help with everything from harassment to pay equity to the company’s strict back-to-office policy. (“Remote work enables disabled folks. Remote work enables caregivers. Remote work enables folks from poverty,” she tweeted on June 2.) Scarlett said she also heard stories from Apple employees with disabilities, who said the company discriminated against them or dismissed their concerns. Meanwhile, stories of sexual harassment began surfacing at Activision Blizzard, so Scarlett used Twitter to funnel victims to a group of women preparing a lawsuit against them. “There is no place anywhere at our company for discrimination, harassment, or unequal treatment of any kind. We appreciate the courage of Ms. Scarlett and other current and former employees who have bravely come forward and shared their experiences,” said Activision Blizzard spokesman Rich George in a statement. “We will fully investigate claims brought to our attention and are committed to the elimination of harassment and discrimination in the workplace.” George said the company has prioritized equal pay for equal work. “It has been our practice for a number of years to specifically take into account our pay equity objectives when making compensation decisions. It is our promise to not let up on this work, and to continue to work towards the removal of any unconscious bias and ensuring equal pay for equal work.” Scarlett also began researching Apple salaries around the country and said she noticed anecdotal evidence of a wage gap. Some employees had tried to do a voluntary wage survey in a company Slack channel, but Apple’s human resources department had put a stop to it, Scarlett said. “I’m pretty sure that’s illegal,” Scarlett told her colleagues in Slack messages. Federal law prohibits employers from barring their workers from discussing wages. Apple did not comment on the allegation that it shut down the wage survey, or whether it believes the alleged actions violate labor law. So on Aug. 7, Scarlett launched a wage survey of her own, outside company channels, and filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board. “I realized that I had once again pulled back the curtain, and it was all lies,” she said. Scarlett said her public stance angered some Apple employees, who accused her on the company’s internal slack channel, without evidence, of leaking confidential information to the press. She says she has never spoken to anyone outside the company about the work she did at Apple, or leaked confidential information. On Aug. 17, she hired a lawyer to represent her. On Sept. 21, she requested paid medical leave through the company’s Human Resources department, due to what she says are mental health issues caused by the accusations. Despite debt, both financial and emotional, leftover from a previous life, Scarlett says she is not worried because for the first time in her life she can see a positive future for herself and her daughter, who is living with her in the Seattle area. “I’ve gone through much worse,” she said. “I know my rights — and I know I can find another job.” The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.

seasonal workers this holiday season — and offering higher pay and signing bonuses - The Washington Post", "author": "Abha Bhattarai", "date": "October 11, 2021 at 12:18 p.m. EDT", "body": "Warehouse jobs were supposed to be the future of the retail industry, offering opportunities for displaced employees and reshaping the American workforce. Amazon, Target, Walmart and other companies pledged to create hundreds of thousands of these positions at competitive wages — and increasingly with perks like free college thrown in — so they could fill the deluge of online orders that began with the coronavirus pandemic and continues unabated. But the industry is facing an unexpected problem: Far too few people are willing to take on the often-grueling work, according to industry officials and economic data. It is the latest sign that the job market is being buffeted by unexpected trends that are leading workers to reconsider the types of positions they want — and upending industries across the economy. “Every year we say, ‘Wow, this is really difficult’ — and every year, it gets more challenging,” said Sabrina Wnorowski, vice president of human resources at Radial, which operates fulfillment centers for brands such as Cole Haan, Aeropostale and the Children’s Place. The company, she said, is offering daily raffles with prizes like PlayStations and iPads, as well as pizza parties and on-site food trucks in a bid to attract 27,000 warehouse workers this year, up 30 percent from 2019. “Given high unemployment, you’d expect that it would be easy to attract labor,” she said, “but it’s been the opposite.” It’s not a ‘labor shortage.’ It’s a great reassessment of work in America. The warehouse industry has already cycled through millions of workers, some of whom say they’ve sworn off warehouse jobs altogether. That, labor economists say, is creating new challenges for retailers scrambling to fill crucial jobs unloading trucks, picking orders and delivering packages. The warehouse and transportation industry had a record 490,000 openings in July, a gap that experts predict will widen in coming months. The dearth of willing workers is hitting companies just as they’re preparing for a fraught holiday season. Supply chain hiccups, shipping delays and out-of-stock products are expected to cut into retailers’ sales and profits, and analysts say staffing shortages make the outlook even more uncertain. The number of seasonal postings advertising “urgent” or “immediate” vacancies on the jobs site Indeed has grown tenfold from a year ago, according to company economist AnnElizabeth Konkel. Many more employers also are advertising hiring incentives like signing bonuses and cash, she said. Gap is touting around-the-clock telehealth appointments and 50 percent discounts on its clothing. Aldi has bumped up the average starting pay at warehouses to $19 an hour. Walmart is promising extra pay for supply chain employees who show up to all scheduled shifts. And Sleep Number is offering sign-on bonuses of as much as $1,000 at distribution centers in Ohio and California, plus free mattresses for all new hires. The country’s largest retailers are going a step further: Walmart, Target and Amazon announced this summer that they would begin offering free college tuition and textbooks to employees. “There is a lot more urgency this year,” Konkel said. “But on the flip side, when we look at job seeker interest, we’re really not seeing a rebound.” Retail workers are quitting at record rates for higher-paying work: ‘My life isn’t worth a dead-end job’ In interviews with more than a dozen current and former warehouse workers across the country, nearly all described being overwhelmed amid staff shortages, with few prospects for moving up. Many spoke of 60-hour workweeks and requests to take on even more shifts during the peak holiday season. Some longtime employees — particularly those who worked through the early days of the pandemic — say they’re resentful of newcomers who are being wooed with large signing bonuses and higher wages. But even those incentives, they say, haven’t been enough to keep workers from leaving. “People quit every single day,” said David, who works at an Amazon fulfillment center in Washington state and asked to be identified by his first name only because he fears retribution at work. “The job is brutal: 10 hours on your feet,” he said. “Half the people quit after their first day.” A spokeswoman for Amazon declined to comment on the worker’s claim or on the company’s overall turnover rate. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.) Labor experts say the nation’s 1.5 million warehouse jobs have been reshaped by the industry’s biggest player: Amazon, which has 950,000 U.S. workers, making it the country’s second-largest private employer. Amazon, according to experts, has had a mixed impact on local job markets. The company has created hundreds of thousands of fulfillment jobs, often at better pay than what’s offered in the local community. At the same time, critics say, it also has dragged down working conditions and wages for the warehouse industry, where starting pay has generally been higher than in other sectors, including retail and hospitality. In counties with an Amazon warehouse, turnover is often double the national industry rate, according to the National Employment Law Project. “Once Amazon gets to town, turnover skyrockets and wages decline,” said Irene Tung, senior researcher and policy analyst for the National Employment Law Project. “Amazon is the standard-bearer, and it is dragging down working conditions for everybody.” The company, which pays a starting hourly rate of $15, often requires employees to work 10-hour shifts with rigid quotas. A recent Washington Post analysis of Occupational Safety and Health Administration data found that rates of serious injury at Amazon are nearly double those of other U.S. warehouses. And this summer, officials in Washington state concluded that there was a “direct connection” between injuries at Amazon warehouses and its “employee monitoring and discipline systems.” Amazon warehouse workers suffer serious injuries at higher rates than other firms “Employers have to wake up to the fact that these jobs are not sustainable,” Tung said. “People can’t stay, because they get injured or because their bodies just give out.” Barbara Agrait, an Amazon spokeswoman, said the company has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in injury-prevention, including a staff of nearly 8,000 safety personnel and ongoing training tools and technology. “The safety and well-being of our employees is always a top priority,” she said in a statement. “When setting [employee] expectations, we take into account things like time in role, experience and their safety and well-being.” She also noted that many employees look to Amazon for short-term work “to make some extra income when they need it.” A “large percentage” of workers, she said, are “rehires,” though she declined to share specifics. The company, which is hoping to hire 125,000 warehouse and logistics workers before the holidays, is offering $3,000 bonuses and starting hourly wages of as much as $22. It also recently dropped marijuana testing requirements. “Coming out of covid, there’s been a major shift in the willingness of workers to take on jobs,” said David Niekerk, a former vice president of human resources for global operations at Amazon. “The volume of workers [warehouses] are looking to hire are pretty staggering at a time when the whole country seems to be having trouble staffing.”  Walmart is looking for 20,000 logistics workers ahead of the holidays, while UPS, Kohl’s and Target are planning to hire about 100,000 apiece. But labor experts say actually finding those employees will be tough in a labor market where there are already more job openings than unemployed Americans. “Employers came into this holiday season already deep into a labor shortage,” said Andrew Challenger, senior vice president at staffing firm Challenger Gray & Christmas. “It’s slamming every industry, but particularly positions in retail, transportation and warehousing — those are by far the hardest jobs to fill right now.” Overworked and exhausted, warehouse workers brace for a frenzied holiday rush Four months into his job at a warehouse in El Paso, Ricardo is already thinking of quitting. He makes $10 an hour preparing orders for customer pickup and delivery, and says he’s exhausted. “I feel like I’m doing the work of six people,” said Ricardo, who asked to be identified by his first name because he fears losing his job. “You know when you’re worked to the bone, and you just want to go home, eat and sleep? It’s like that all the time.” Analysts note that warehouse and delivery workers are under increased pressure this year, given widespread product shortages and shipping delays that are complicating an already stressful environment. “Workers are exhausted, and they’re working very physical jobs,” said Ellen Reese, chair of labor studies at the University of California at Riverside. “Add in the long hours and quick pace of the holiday season, and that can lead to a lot of additional risks.” In Colorado, uniform company UniFirst has for months been posting job openings promising life insurance, employee discounts and weekends off. But so far, hardly anyone is interested. “We are overwhelmed, understaffed and without applicants,” said a driver for the company, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he fears losing his job. “The only applicants we’ve been getting are middle-aged men in their 50s and 60s. When we do get anyone younger than 30, they’re usually here no more than a month.” While competitors have raised wages, starting pay at the facility remains $15 an hour, he said. UniFirst spokesman Adam Soreff said the company provides competitive pay and benefits. But “like many companies in today’s market, we are operating in a difficult and challenging environment.” The employee said he is trying to keep pace by clocking 14-hour shifts, five days a week. But after 18 years in the industry, he’s considering leaving it altogether. “Morale is low,” he said. “Nearly every day, I’ll sit in my car for 10 minutes in the employee parking lot and say to myself, ‘Just get through another day.' ” The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.

"Deadlines arrive for school staff to be vaccinated in Washington region - The Washington Post", "author": "Donna St. George", "date": "6:00 a.m. EDT", "body": "Teachers and other school staff in Arlington have reached a deadline to be vaccinated — among the first school systems in the Washington region to begin enforcing a coronavirus vaccination mandate as the pandemic persists. In coming weeks, other school systems in Virginia, D.C. and Maryland will cross the same public health threshold, which could mean days out of work, disciplinary action or in the worst case firings for those who do not meet their district’s vaccination requirements. Most school employees in the region, by far, have been vaccinated, according to school system data collected by The Washington Post. But numbers for seven of the area’s central school systems also show hundreds or thousands have not yet reported their statuses or been immunized. “The intention here is communal safety,” said Brenda Wolff, president of the school board in Maryland’s Montgomery County, the state’s largest school system. “This is the only way we can keep students in school.” In Arlington, where the deadline was Friday, those who have not complied — or obtained a medical or religious exemption — will not be allowed at work Monday in the Virginia school system, said spokesman Frank Bellavia. Those with exemptions must get weekly on-site testing, he said. The rollout of coronavirus vaccine mandates has not appeared to encounter major hurdles, although some parents and teachers have spoken out to argue the decision to get vaccinated should be a personal one. At least one group of teachers and staff posted a petition against a mandate in Montgomery County, saying they stand to be “unjustifiably terminated” because of it. But many teachers association leaders have supported vaccination requirements — as do school system officials, who say the mandates are necessary to combat the threat of the virus’s highly contagious delta variant and so kids can remain healthy in their classrooms. Vaccination mandate tightened for Montgomery County teachers and other staff in schools In at least one area, the fallout of vaccine requirements is becoming visible. Some employees who are unvaccinated in Maryland’s Prince George’s County have been placed on unpaid leave because they have not submitted weekly testing results as required, said spokeswoman Meghan Gebreselassie. No exact number was available yet because it is being done at the school level and multiple contractors are involved, she said. The deadline for compliance was Aug. 27, and about 3,400 employees of the system’s workforce of roughly 22,300 — including temporary and substitute employees — opted for weekly testing, rather than vaccination, she said. Prince George’s offers testing each Monday at more than 180 schools and five hub sites. Employees may also be tested elsewhere and submit proof. “We are highly encouraging our staff to get the vaccine,” Gebreselassie said. Other school systems have deadlines as late as mid-November — as in Montgomery County and Alexandria —  and many have pushed back their original cut-offs to give employees more time to meet the requirement. As of this month, Fairfax County reported the highest employee vaccination rate among school systems — 97.6 percent fully vaccinated, of its roughly 29,000 staffers — with a deadline that is still a couple weeks off, on Nov. 1. That compares to 91 percent in Arlington, nearly 88 percent in Montgomery County, 85 percent in Loudoun,  82 percent in Prince George’s County and 71 percent in D.C.’s public school system. Some school systems allow weekly testing as an alternative to vaccination and some do not. As of mid-October, 88 percent of the Alexandria schools workforce is fully vaccinated, said spokeswoman Claire Going. Eight percent are participating in weekly testing instead. Christopher A. Suarez, a school board member for Alexandria City Public Schools who has been an outspoken advocate for staff vaccination, said at a recent board meeting that it is imperative for school officials to ensure staff comply. “This is a really uncertain time, a really scary time,” he said, citing the rise of the delta variant of the coronavirus. “We need to give maximum assurances to our community that we’re doing everything we can do.” Back-to-school in Northern Virginia means virus testing, vaccine mandates, virtual learning amid quarantines In Montgomery County, with roughly 24,500 employees, more than 21,500 have reported being fully vaccinated, leaving nearly 3,000 to comply by Nov. 15. Teacher associations have been broadly supportive of vaccine mandates, including the Fairfax Education Association, which put out a statement in mid-August calling for a vaccine requirement for staff before the Fairfax school system issued one. Association president Kimberly Adams said recently that she hopes vaccine mandates will eventually extend to students as well — including the county’s youngest children, if and when federal health agencies approve the vaccine for that population. “Data . . . shows that vaccination of students ages 5 to 11 will be our next best step to ending this pandemic,” Adams said. When the mandate was announced in D.C., the Washington Teachers’ Union said it strongly favored teachers getting vaccinated but wished the city had negotiated the terms of the mandate with the union, arguing that it is unclear how the mandate will be enforced and what would happen to people who have extenuating circumstances that may not be covered by the narrow religious and medical exemptions. In Maryland, leaders of teachers unions in the largest school systems — in Montgomery County and Prince George’s — support vaccination requirements. But they come at a time when school systems are already grappling with the effects of staffing shortages. Depending on how compliance goes, it could add another layer of struggle. Teachers are already covering for colleagues out sick or quarantined, or positions left vacant. “The staffing shortage is the most significant I have seen in my 25 years in public education,” said Donna Christy, president of the Prince George’s County Educators’ Association. \n \n \n Local newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.) Like PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.

In all, the school system will spend $22 million to hire nearly 250 new employees as part of the pandemic-related hiring spree. There’s also funding for each of the 120 campuses to hire an additional coronavirus-related staff member. The new positions highlight the complexities and steep costs required to operate schools during the pandemic. Positive cases in classrooms and subsequent quarantines requires more communication with families, putting extra administrative duties on educators. And frequent testing of students necessitates more staff members to watch children outside of the classroom and conduct tests. But with a national staffing shortage in schools, the ambitious hiring goal could be a challenge, though city officials say they hope that raises for substitute teachers and well-paying jobs could help the District buck this trend. Coronavirus challenges in first weeks of school in the District The city will use contingency budget funds to initially pay for the hires, and then reimburse that money from the influx of federal relief funds. “After a strong reopening, we are focused on supporting … school communities as they continue to implement robust mitigation strategies,” Mayor Muriel E. Bowser said in a statement. An understaffed contact tracing team has resulted in delays of families being informed about positive cases in classrooms and has forced principals to make uninformed decisions about who was exposed to the virus and needs to quarantine, The Washington Post reported last month. The school system plans to will double its number of in-house contact tracers to 20 people. The funding will also enable the school system to assign each school a “Covid Strategy & Logistics Coordinator” who will help with contact tracing, notifications to families, and student testing. The city is supposed to test a random sample of 10 percent of students at every school each week. By Nov. 15, under a D.C. Council bill, the city would need to test 20 percent of students at each school. But the city has struggled to reach its asymptomatic testing goals. Each coronavirus test that the schools conduct cost $13, far lower than the $75 to $100 for commercial PCR tests, according to city data. The District has used federal funds to pay for the tests, and officials said money has not hindered testing. But it requires a significant amount of time to collect an adequate saliva sample from each student, and there is often not enough staffing to supervise classrooms and watch the students who are pulled out for testing. Richard Jackson, who heads the Council of School Officers, a union for mid-level leadership in the school system, said principals welcomed the news of the additional hires, but they fear it could take a long time to get these new staffers in schools since they are still waiting on open teaching positions to be filled. How strict should rules to participate in virtual learning be? “Principals are so overburdened that any additional help is going to be welcome, simply because it helps getting the work done,” Jackson said. The funding will also assign a permanent substitute teacher to every school. Each day of this academic year, the 52,000-student school system requests an average of 179 substitute teachers, but only fills 121 of those requests, according to data obtained by the office of D.C. Council member Janeese Lewis George (D-Ward 4). Part of the reason, according to the data, is that the city has fewer people in its substitute teacher pool. There are currently 662 substitute teachers in the pool, compared to 853 in the available group during the previous academic year. In July, Myrtle Washington, president of Washington Substitute Teacher United, testified that substitute teachers in the school system are required to have a college degree and earn 15 dollars per hour. She called on the city to increase their pay. “Do you know how much a school schedule is disrupted when substitute teachers do not show up?” Washington said. “I — we — do more than babysit.” D.C. Public Schools Chancellor Lewis D. Ferebee said in a letter to staff on Thursday that the school system would create financial incentives to attract more substitute teachers. He called on staff members to ask retired teachers they know to join the substitute teacher pool and said that they are getting staff who work in the school system’s headquarters to receive clearance to work in classrooms. \n The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.

And that’s what you did.” He then sentenced Maxwell Bero — a former history teacher at what was then Col. E. Brooke Lee Middle School in Silver Spring as well as a former candidate for Congress — to eight years in prison. Bero, 31, had previously pleaded guilty to sexually abusing two of his students after prosecutors say he spent months grooming and persuading them into his confidence. Detectives said Bero sent one of the girls a nude picture of himself from his own bachelor party. Inside his classroom, he later groped and fondled that student while she sat on his lap and they were alone at the end of school days. Bero also sent nude photos to a second student, whom he touched inappropriately during a student club activity in his classroom. The grooming of both students, authorities said, began after Bero posted his Kik social media name on his classroom board and invited students to message him directly, ostensibly about heir school work. “To violate that kind of trust is pretty heinous,” Boynton said. Police say teacher sent nude photo of himself to eighth grader The abuse occurred in 2014 and 2015 but went unknown for years. In 2019, Bero made an unsuccessful bid for Congress on a progressive platform to address climate change and health care. Then a year later, one victim came forward, leading to Bero’s arrest. As part of a more recent plea deal with prosecutors, Bero’s maximum penalty was capped at 10 years. It is unlikely Bero will serve the full eight years. In Maryland, inmates are eligible for parole consideration after 25 percent of their sentences have been served if they were convicted of a nonviolent offense, a category that includes sexual abuse of minors, according to prosecutors. During the 90-minute sentencing hearing Friday, one of the victims spoke, as did Bero, his stepfather and his wife. The victim, now 21 and speaking remotely into the courtroom, recalled the effects of the abuse as a teenager: “I remember many nights in high school, sitting in my towel after a shower, sobbing. I felt repulsed and angered by my own body.” She said she suffers from depression, an anxiety disorder and PTSD from the abuse. “I have lots of trouble sleeping. I cry almost every day,” she said. “I have tremendous trouble feeling safe in my own body.” As the victim spoke, Bero sat at a table, looking down and taking notes or a sip of water. His wife had earlier spoke in the courtroom, expressing her sorrow toward the victims and saying how her husband has worked to change himself. “I do believe that love can endure,” she said, adding that relationships, no matter how fractured, “can be mended.” Bero spoke for nearly nine minutes. “Your honor, reaching the decision to take a plea in this matter was a difficult one for me,” he began. “I consider myself a student of the Constitution — as I carried one in my pocket for 10 years — and an advocate for American civil rights. At first, taking the plea felt like giving up those rights, regardless of the guilt.” Attorney says attack by football players was not sexual assault But he said he’d come to understand “the reality of the criminal justice system” and how actions fit therein. “My conduct over six years ago was inappropriate, criminal and morally reprehensible,” Bero said. He praised the victims for showing “bravery and strength” for coming forward, and said he did not want to further traumatize them with a trial. Bero also paraphrased a legendary sports figure when he said, “Golfer Bobby Jones once compared golf to life, saying you have bad breaks and good breaks, but you have to play the ball where it lies.” Bero continued, “For a long time, my mind could not accept that it was me who participated in this inappropriate criminal conduct. I refused to play the ball where it lies and face my actions” and “I am now able to effectively play the ball where it lies and accept what I have done.” He thanked his support groups and said that embracing some Buddhist ideologies has also strengthened his own Catholic faith. “I have done a lot of good in my life, both professional and personal,” Bero said. “I have accepted that the good I have done does not erase or minimize my conduct which brings me in front of the court today.” Police training gains clout as law enforcement seeks to reduce killings County has spent over $17 million fighting officers who allege racism Teens drive spike in carjackings with pandemic limiting supervision The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.

Democrats also spent significantly more during the filing period, which covers donations and expenditures made from Sept. 1 to Sept. 30. McAuliffe spent $17.5 million, while Youngkin spent $9.5 million, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Virginia Public Access Project (VPAP). McAuliffe also received more small donations than Youngkin did, getting more than 41,000 donations of $100 or less versus Youngkin’s 13,000, according to VPAP. McAuliffe also went into the final month of the race with more than double the amount of cash on hand compared with Youngkin, including money carried over from previous campaign finance reporting periods. McAuliffe ended the month with $7.8 million in the bank, while Youngkin had $3.5 million. The previous campaign finance report, which detailed spending for July and August, had Youngkin leading in contributions with $15.7 million, compared with McAuliffe’s $11.5 million. Youngkin, a former private-equity executive, reported loaning his campaign $4.5 million during the summer. In the latest filing, Youngkin reported no new personal loans to his campaign. The political action arm of the Republican Governors Association continued to be his top donor, contributing $1.5 million in September. His only other donation over $100,000 came from Haulover Creek Development Company, according to VPAP. What to know about the 2021 Virginia governor’s race McAuliffe’s top donation came the Democratic Governors Association, with $1.1 million in contributions for the period. He continued to receive large donations from labor unions and political groups, like $400,000 from Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun-control advocacy group, and $250,000 from the Mid-Atlantic Laborers’ Political Education Fund. According to VPAP, McAuliffe also received $200,000 from Gordon Gund, former owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers. In September, Democrats nationally grew increasingly wary of the tight margins of the Virginia race, a bellwether election that’s expected to be an indicator of how Democrats might fare in next year’s midterms. The competition also kicked into full gear in September, with the candidates sparring in two debates that month and spending heavily on advertising. Early voting began Sept. 17 and Election Day is Nov. 2. The total fundraising of both candidates reached about $88 million in September, well surpassing the $66 million raised during the entirety of the 2017 governor’s race, with about a month more of fundraising to go. That year, Gov. Ralph Northam (D) raised $5.6 million in September, less than half of McAuliffe’s contributions for the same reporting period, according to campaign finance filings. Independent candidate Princess Blanding reported raising $8,367 in September and has $6,339 cash on hand. The ballot in November also includes lieutenant governor and attorney general, along with all 100 seats in the House of Delegates, where Democrats are defending a 55-45 majority. In the lieutenant governor’s race, Del. Hala S. Ayala (D-Prince William) raised $1.6 million during the reporting period, almost twice the amount she collected in July and August. She ended the reporting period with just over $1 million cash on hand. Ayala’s top donors included PACs and unions, like Everytown for Gun Safety, which donated $200,000, and Planned Parenthood Virginia PAC, which contributed $150,000. The Service Employees International Union gave her campaign $100,000. Youth voter turnout in Virginia soared with Trump in office. Will it stay that way? Republican lieutenant governor candidate Winsome E. Sears, a former delegate in Norfolk, brought in about $575,000 in September and ended the period with just over $480,000. The national Republican State Leadership Committee kicked in $100,000 to Sears. The Virginia Citizens Defense League, a gun rights advocacy group, and Haulover Creek Development both donated $25,000. At the beginning of September, Sears had laid off her campaign manager and other staffers, in part over fundraising. Incumbent Virginia Attorney General Mark R. Herring (D) reported raising about $1.3 million in September in his reelection bid and ended the period with about $1.9 million. Herring’s top donors include $200,000 from Everytown for Gun Safety and $100,000 from Planned Parenthood Action Fund. Republican challenger Del. Jason S. Miyares (Virginia Beach) reported raising about $1.4 million in September, nearly double what he raised in July and August. He went into October with just over $850,000 in hand. Miyares’s top donation of $500,000 during the reporting period came from the Republican Attorneys General Association. Candidates have one more campaign finance filing deadline on Oct. 25, which will be the last one before the election.

It was also a good day to not be manning the U.S. Army’s Nike missile site at Fort Meade in Anne Arundel County, Md. At around 12:35 p.m. on that Thursday, one of the 22-foot-tall antiaircraft missiles was accidentally launched from Fort Meade. It traveled three miles before exploding above the parkway, showering the pavement with debris. “Luckily, no cars were moving along the section of the parkway a half-mile south of the Laurel-Fort Meade overpass when the fragments of the guided missile splattered down,” wrote The Post. The only injury was to Sgt. Stanley C. Kozak, who was standing near the missile when it took off. He suffered minor burns. The Fort Meade Nike site was just one spiky bead in a necklace built around Washington in 1954 to protect the capital from Soviet bombers. In 1948, one demonstration of a ‘hands-off’ B-17 landing almost went very wrong There’s an adage that generals fight the last war. For the United States, World War II had started and ended with bombs dropped from aircraft. “So defense planners in the late 1940s and early 1950s assumed that the next war would similarly involve large masses of enemy bombers — in this case Soviet bombers — attacking American cities and defense sites and population centers,” said Christopher J. Bright, a Cold War historian and author. Named for the Greek goddess of victory, the missiles were deployed at 13 sites ringing Washington, from Laytonsville, Md., to Pomonkey, Md., Annapolis to Great Falls, Va. Other U.S. cities were similarly protected. Each installation featured two components: a missile battery, where the weapons were stored in underground magazines, from which they could be lifted  and fired, and a control center about a mile away, where the radar equipment that guided the missiles was located. “In the ’50s, this was in the really rural outreaches of the Washington area,” Bright said. Some sites were built on government land — such as at Fort Meade and Lorton, Va., at the prison farm whose Nike site became a showcase for the technology. Other land was taken by eminent domain. G.H. Anderson had to sell part of his tobacco farm near Waldorf, Md. (He complained to the Washington Evening Star that the government took the best part “and left me the corners.”) Though the specifics of the Nike technology may have been secret, there was no effort to hide the sites themselves from the public. Said Bright: “In most instances, they were welcomed to the community. People were happy to have them.” There was even an episode of “Lassie” where Timmy and his collie visit a Nike missile base. But every weapon is inherently dangerous. On May 22, 1958, a crew was servicing Nike missiles at a site in Middletown, N.J. One missile exploded, starting a chain reaction that set off seven others, causing what the Associated Press called “a furious mushroom of fire and death.” Six soldiers and four civilian contractors were killed. The missiles that exploded were of the Nike Ajax variety. They held conventional explosives. But the Army was in the process of introducing a new and improved weapon: the Nike Hercules, each equipped with a nuclear warhead. “If it were to target an incoming aircraft or group of aircraft, a relatively small nuclear detonation would assuredly destroy the attackers,” Bright said. In the wake of the New Jersey tragedy, the Army assured the public that elaborate precautions were taken in the design and handling of the Nike Hercules and that an accidental nuclear explosion was unlikely. Did the missiles work? Well, the Soviets never launched a wave of bombers at the United States. But on the very day the Star wrote about the Fort Meade mishap, a prescient article ran on the same page. The headline: “Russia Will Build Cruising Missile, Chidlaw Predicts.” Gen. Benjamin W. Chidlaw was the head of the Continental Air Defense Command. The Soviets, he said, were developing missiles with speeds of between 8,000 and 16,000 mph, capable of reaching American soil. The future threat would not be bombers, but  intercontinental ballistic missiles or missiles launched from submarines. By 1974 — a little later in Florida, what with Cuba across the water — the Nike program was over. In the 20 years the Nike sites were active, the suburbs had grown to reach them. Some of the sites remained in federal hands, used for storage or by other government agencies. Others were turned over to local agencies, often becoming parkland, as at Nike Missile Park in Gaithersburg and Popes Head Park in Fairfax. Some were sold to the private sector for development. In fact, if you fancy your own Nike missile site, the GSA has one on the market right now: 14 acres off Muddy Branch Road in Gaithersburg. The bidding is currently at $9.2 million — missiles not included. \n Twitter: @johnkelly  For previous columns, visit washingtonpost.com/john-kelly.

So far, 2021 is worse. The Soul Box Project was created by survivors, families of victims and volunteers who spent countless hours making the boxes and colorfully decorating them with photos of the victims, drawings, poignant tributes and calls to end gun violence. One box features bright yellow paper that reads: “Anthony Wells age 3 found a gun and killed himself.” Another features a target and reads: “Who will be next?” A third shows a hand-drawn image of a gun with its barrel tied in a knot. The project includes victims who have died in street violence, by suicide, by police and by accident. The boxes displayed on 800 feet of panels and in 600 bags stretch on and on, spanning the Mall from the Smithsonian Castle on one side to the Museum of Natural History on the other. A gong at the center of the display rings every 15 minutes, representing the frequency of deaths from gun violence in America. The sheer scale of the tragedy the project represents left many visitors agog. “I’m blown away,” said Nico Laudenberg, a German woman who lives in Michigan and was visiting D.C. for the day. Leslie Lee, a Portland, Ore. artist, said she conceived of the project after a gunman killed 60 people during a concert in Las Vegas in 2017. Lee said she was appalled by the massacre, but also by her reaction to it. She recalled snapping off her phone when first reading the news, overwhelmed by yet another mass shooting. She said she wanted to do something about gun violence, but felt there needed to be a way to bring the issue home. The statistics and numbers around the issue were too large and too abstract. “Seventy-thousand people killed or injured every single year that doesn’t mean a lot,” Lee said. “We need a visual. We need to be able to see so that we can feel. So people will take action on an individual basis.” As gun violence spreads to small towns, one suburb contends with a mass shooting’s aftermath Lee said she settled on origami boxes because they are cheap, easy to make and light,  which means more people can participate and allows the project to travel around the country raising awareness. The project took 36,000 boxes into the state capitol in Oregon and more than 9,000 to Grand Rapids, Mich. The installation on the Mall, which runs through Sunday, is the first time the Soul Box Project has been displayed in D.C., and Lee said it represents the culmination of their work, although it will continue to tour. The project comes to D.C. amid a surge in gun violence locally and nationally. Last month, the FBI reported a 30 percent increase in homicides in the United States last year, and many cities are struggling with increased shootings. D.C. has seen an 8 percent increase in killings this year, after setting a 16-year high in 2020. Many of those deaths were gun-related. Lee describes the Soul Box Project as nonpartisan, but it does support the work of gun-control groups such as Everytown for Gun Safety and The Brady Campaign. Participating in the project has been therapeutic for some. Michelle Bounds, a Portland resident, said she accidentally shot herself after picking up a gun during an argument with her former partner. She said she picked up the weapon to make the point he should not have brought it into their house, but it went off and a bullet went through her chin and exited near her temple.

She is part of a group that has made 5,239 boxes. “The value of holding a soul in that box is very meaningful, and there are way too many of them,” Bounds said. \n The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.

Wind can be refreshing, but occasional gusts near 30 mph aren’t ideal. Neither are we acclimated to cooler 60s for highs! Still, it’s nice to nix the humidity. We’re sunny, cooler and a bit blustery through tomorrow. The weather “good life” is slowly returning though, earned after all the recent clouds and stickiness. Try to ignore the occasionally gusty wind, which is part and parcel with the change in season. As we transition further into fall, the polar jet stream moves back overhead from its summer home in Canada. Get our daily forecasts on your Amazon Alexa device. Today (Sunday): A big difference today with much cooler air, very low humidity and crisp winds from the northwest gusting as high as 30 mph. After some spots start the day in the mid-to-upper 40s, morning temperatures rise through the 50s under mostly sunny skies. A few clouds could pop up during the afternoon, and can’t rule out a stray sprinkle, as highs reach the low to mid-60s (but feeling like the 50s most of the day with the wind). A decent day for outdoor activities if you dress in layers and consider a windbreaker jacket, for instance. Confidence: Medium-High Tonight: Still breezy at times as we get into the evening with temperatures dropping back into the 50s. Skies continue mostly clear overnight as winds turn lighter from the west. Lows range from the mid-40s outside the Beltway to the upper 40s to near 50 downtown. It’s feeling a bit chillier than average for this time of year due to a bit of a lingering breeze, but air temperatures themselves are about right for this point in October. Skies are mostly clear.

Keep reading for the forecast into midweek… Tomorrow (Monday): Blue and sunny skies await us, but so do the winds from the northwest, which ramp up again with gusts near 30 mph. High temperatures remain slightly below average, in the low to mid-60s. If the winds die down sooner than expected, we could see some upper 60s. Confidence: Medium Tomorrow night: Mostly clear skies as winds slacken substantially, to around 5 mph before dawn. Low temperatures may bottom out in the chilliest range of this forecast period, with most spots in the 40s. If winds go calm enough, we could see some spots away from the Beltway touch the upper 30s. Confidence: Medium-High Sunshine and comfort should rule Tuesday and Wednesday, with high temperatures near 70 to the mid-70s. Winds are mainly light from the west. Tuesday night lows cool off to the upper 40s and low 50s, as light winds and mostly clear skies continue to allow the daytime warmth to escape quickly and effectively at night.

For more free stories, sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter. Coronavirus case rates are beginning to plateau in the District, Maryland and Virginia, with declines in the Washington metro area. Vaccination rates are climbing upward in all three jurisdictions, though D.C. and several neighboring counties still have indoor mask mandates. Case rates in the region started rising in July, driven in large part by relaxed restrictions on gatherings and the spread of the highly contagious delta variant among pockets of unvaccinated people. This bump in infections was not as high as the winter surge earlier this year â a testament to the effectiveness of the coronavirus vaccines, experts say. Virginia, which has struggled to boost vaccination rates in its southwest region, saw a bigger increase in cases than D.C. or Maryland. Deaths, which often lag caseloads by several weeks, have increased in recent weeks, but not at the rates of previous waves of the virus. At least  have been reported since Feb. 29. Show by Many restrictions on dining, shopping and gathering have been lifted, allowing ebullient but wary residents to reunite with their loved ones and resume some of their pre-pandemic routines. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued new guidance in July, calling for both vaccinated and unvaccinated people to resume wearing masks in indoor public places in areas where coronavirus transmission rates are substantial or high. Much of Virginia and Maryland are in this category, as is D.C. While some jurisdictions, including D.C., Montgomery and Prince Georgeâs counties, and Baltimore City, have opted to restore their indoor mask mandates, with Prince Georgeâs recently increasing it to cover children ages 2 to 5, other jurisdictions have kept it optional. Businesses have the option of keeping mask requirements in place. [U.S. coronavirus cases and state maps: Tracking cases, deaths] Teachers have been vaccinated in many places and most school districts have resumed in-person classes for the fall, though debate over stringent quarantine policies, rapid testing and vaccine mandates continue amid virus outbreaks at schools. Coronavirus vaccines have yet to be approved for children younger than 12. Virginia, Maryland and the District are no longer facing more demand for the vaccine than they have available supply. Each jurisdiction has shifted from an appointment-based system to extensive outreach and walk-in vaccination options. They are also offering incentives for people to get vaccinated, including a Maryland lottery program for people who have been vaccinated that had a top prize of $400,000 and a college scholarship lottery for Maryland teenagers who have gotten vaccinated. Counties have started to bridge the large racial disparities among those vaccinated, though significant gaps persist between rural and urban areas. Note: Partially vaccinated shows people who have received one dose of a two-dose vaccine. Fully vaccinated shows people who have completed vaccination, either through both doses of a two-dose vaccine, or a single dose of a one-dose vaccine. [Tracking the covid vaccine: Doses and people vaccinated by state] In April, as the supply of doses increased, eligibility opened to everyone over 16 in the District and across the country. In May, the CDC approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for 12-to-15-year-olds, prompting a surge of vaccinations among younger adolescents. Note: The total number of tests is calculated as reported negative tests plus reported positive tests. The percent positive is calculated as reported positive tests in the last seven days divided by total reported tests in the last seven days. The last seven days are counted from the most recent date reported. Hospitalizations have increased along with a recent bump in cases, but not to the extent that they did during the winter surge. Hospital systems in rural parts of the region, where vaccination rates tend to be lower, say theyâre struggling to keep up with the influx of patients who have yet to be immunized against the virus. Intensive-care hospitalizations have also risen, though they are still at low levels relative to much of the pandemic. This case tracker relies on data provided by the Maryland, D.C. and Virginia health departments. Earlier in the pandemic, The Washington Post made small adjustments to some of the data to account for unexplained fluctuations in the state reports. On May 1, with the number of cases exceeding 45,000, The Post switched to a more automated process that does not allow for those adjustments. This resulted in a minor fluctuation in the state totals on May 1 and some small discrepancies in the historical data shown for April 25. Deaths are recorded on the dates they are announced, not necessarily the dates they occur. Hospitalization data since July 15, 2020, is from the Department of Health and Human Services TeleTracking and HHS Protect hospital reporting systems. It updates once daily by early afternoon, but should be considered provisional until updated with weekly historical HHS data. Hospitalization data before July 15 was provided by state health departments. Data on vaccination doses administered is from the CDC. The data includes vaccinations administered by the Defense Department, the Veterans Health Administration, Indian Health Service and Bureau of Prisons attributed to the state in which they were given. Vaccination totals for D.C. include a sizable number of nonresidents who commute into the District from neighboring states for work. Testing data is from the Covid-19 Tracking Project. All numbers are provisional and may be revised by the jurisdictions. The seven-day rolling average uses the past seven days of new daily reported cases or deaths to calculate a daily average, starting from the most recent full day of data. Population data are five-year estimates from the 2019 American Community Survey by the U.S. Census Bureau. Originally published March 13, 2020.

More stories The death toll from covid-19 began to rise steadily in early March, then more sharply as the disease spread to every state and most U.S. territories. In the months since the outbreak of a new coronavirus was first reported in China late last year, millions of people have contracted it globally, with cases reported in nearly every country in the world.

look at reader communication. For his recent birthday, Marc Ferrara was treated to dinner by his partner at Clyde’s at Gallery Place. “We hoped for lobster and crab cakes, but neither was on the menu. We could understand those limitations in these times,” wrote the Washington reader in an email. Ferrara opted for a swordfish steak, but not before asking his server if the catch was sustainably harvested. “She replied that the swordfish was sustainably farmed,” wrote Ferrara. “Neither my partner nor I could envision a swordfish farm, so we asked her to confirm that with the chef.” A few minutes later, she returned with confirmation from the kitchen. When his entree arrived, Ferrara says he archly asked the food runners, “‘So this is the farmed swordfish?' and one of them replied, ‘Yes, 100 percent farmed.’” Tom Sietsema's 2021 Fall Dining Guide Ferrara asks, “Are they all in on a deception, or am I behind the times in what can be farmed? My research today has not shown me that I am. Thanks for any investigation.” When I reached out for comment from the restaurant, a spokeswoman confirmed the staff’s mistake. “We really dropped the ball on that one,” says Molly Quigley. While the restaurant company likes to innovate, she says, “Clyde’s has yet to invent a swordfish farm. Those suckers are fast and migratory.” Ferrara’s entree turned out to be wild-caught North Atlantic swordfish, currently rated green, a “best” choice, by the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch. The restaurant’s admission of error and speedy response won it a new fan, says Ferrara. “I will be sure to eat at Clyde’s an extra time this year because of their practices and customer service.” Nadine Brown has worked in Washington restaurants since 1997, including a 14-year run as sommelier at Charlie Palmer Steak, which set itself apart from the competition with an all-American wine list. I thought she would be the ideal person to address some wine questions sent to me by Ed Curvey of Silver Spring, who wants to know what the policy is for diners who want to bring their own wine to restaurants and “what’s a normal corkage fee?” Easy question first: While there are “no fast rules,” the average price to bring wine from outside tends to be between $25 and $50, says Brown, the founder of At Your Service, a wine consulting and private event company. The fee generally varies depending upon the caliber of the restaurant and the level of service it offers. Brown says the pandemic has changed her thinking about wine from outside. Whereas she was fine with the practice pre-covid, “restaurants are struggling now,\" and the profit on wine sales helps the bottom line. She proposes a compromise: “Bring a bottle, buy a bottle” from the restaurant. My informal survey of Washington restaurants at different price levels supports Brown’s response. All-Purpose Pizza charges a $25 corkage fee per bottle — and has no limit on the number. The fee at the Knightsbridge Restaurant Group, a collection that includes Annabelle, Modena, Rasika and Sababa, is $35 per bottle with a maximum of two bottles. Oyster Oyster charges $40 per bottle, while Reveler’s Hour asks for $50, the same price as Marcel’s, the fine-dining French establishment, which permits two bottles. Restaurants can pretty much set their own rules; some, including the top-tier Fiola, do not allow outside wine. “Our team is delighted to assist you in making a selection from our award-winning wine list,” featuring “deep verticals of top Italian wine producers and selections from the rarest vineyards, including some no longer in production,” reads a note on the restaurant’s website. Tom Sietsema’s 10 favorite restaurant dishes in the D.C. area Bill Jensen, a co-owner of Reveler’s Hour and Tail Up Goat, speaks for many of his peers in the business when he asks customers to consider the time and attention sommeliers put into their lists. “I have mixed feelings about outside wine as someone who populates our lists with the same passion that chefs compile a menu,” he says. “I recognize that wine has sentimental value, and I understand the appeal of making it a central part of a night out. I’m genuinely honored when people want to share those kinds of bottles with us. That said, the beverage experience is a massive part of any restaurant visit and something I personally would never want to opt out of. Allowing corkage but limiting it to one bottle feels like a nice balance for us across both restaurants.” Like All-Purpose Pizza, Oyster Oyster doesn’t limit how much outside wine can be brought in, although, per Brown’s advice, diners should “consider supplementing anything they bring with a purchase from our list if they’re going to be enjoying multiple bottles,” says Sarah Horvitz, beverage director at the plant-based, sustainably focused restaurant. “From our guests, we’d just ask that they consider the fact that beverage sales are a crucial part of covering restaurant expenses, like keeping the lights on and supporting our staff. Also, we love to highlight producers whose ethos aligns with our own, and thus being able to support them while potentially introducing a guest to something new they’ll love is really exciting for us.” Got a special wine that needs decanting? Moez Ben Achour, general manager and sommelier from Marcel’s, advises guests to bring the bottle to the restaurant ahead of dinner, so he can show it to best advantage. Early is better than later. Brown recalls the time a guest at Charlie Palmer Steak dropped a case of wine off at 5 p.m. for an 8 p.m. reservation — and this on a Friday. “That’s excessive,” she says. Earlier this year, I wrote about restaurant pivots that I hoped would outlast the pandemic, a list that included cocktails to go, takeout from more than the expected Chinese and pizza places, and year-round outdoor dining. The story prompted Arlington reader Jeff Liteman to add to the list. “No, it’s not QR codes in place of paper menus. Definitely not,” he joked in an email. Rather, Liteman liked what he saw while dining outside Thai Select in Arlington: “Fastened to each table was a button that connected wirelessly to a bell indoors, where the wait staff could hear it.” He wishes more restaurants with alfresco seating would adopt the idea, which he considers a better strategy than “standing and gesticulating wildly” to catch a server’s attention. (There’s precedent for the system. Before the pandemic, for instance, some Chick-fil-A locations tested a “butler button” that allowed customers to order more food or summon a server or manager after their initial order. Shades of “Downton Abbey” at fast-food prices!) El Secreto de Rosita seasons its pan-Latin menu with charms galore Debbie Ratanaprasith, who manages the family-owned restaurant, says the call buttons — inspired by those used by seniors to flag caregivers at home — were installed about six months ago, after Thai Select added 24 seats outside. “We want to make sure we take great care of customers,” no matter where they’re sitting, she says. Among other things, call buttons mean servers don’t have to hover over a large party pondering menu choices. “We just tell them to ring us.” The restaurant spent about $40 to make life easier for all involved, an investment with potential rewards for the business, figures Liteman. “Happy customers write positive reviews, pay return visits and leave bigger tips,” he says.

Boodman", "date": "10:00 a.m. EDT", "body": "For nearly a decade, Sherrill Franklin battled an elusive foe. She lost 22 pounds without trying. Her face was flushed, her neck felt sweaty and clammy, and she felt inexplicably jittery. At times Franklin, who lives in a rural community an hour west of Philadelphia, endured bouts of dizziness. It wasn’t until a worrisome new problem landed her in the hospital that a specialist, one of nearly two dozen doctors she consulted, ordered a blood test that revealed the reason she felt so sick. Franklin regrets the wasted years and regards her experience as an unfortunate combination of flawed assumptions, missed opportunities and red herrings. “It’s been very expensive and it’s been miserable,” she said. Franklin is perturbed that doctors repeatedly appeared to overlook the likely cause of her illness. And she believes that some of her actions may have unintentionally contributed to the protracted diagnostic delay. \"I've learned a lot by going through what happened and why,\" she observed. \"I hope others do, too.\" In spring 2008 Franklin, who owns a business that produces products for museum stores, sought treatment for Lyme disease. She had the classic bull's eye rash and the nurse practitioner in her internist’s office prescribed the standard treatment: a course of oral antibiotics. Franklin, then 56, was wary — and worried. This was not her first case of Lyme. Twenty-one years earlier, while pregnant, she had struggled for two years with a tick bite that had been inadequately treated. She said it was only after she contacted the Yale doctor who first identified Lyme disease that she learned she would need three weeks of intravenous antibiotics. She received treatment and fully recovered. In the weeks after her second Lyme diagnosis, Franklin said she was beset by a constellation of problems that included nervousness, muscle weakness and sweating. Because these symptoms were unlike those she’d experienced the first time, Franklin wondered whether she had contracted a different strain of Lyme. (There are more than a dozen.) Her internist suspected a possible metabolic problem and suggested she see an endocrinologist. The Philadelphia specialist she consulted “seemed irritated and floored by all my symptoms,” Franklin recalled, but wasn’t sure what was wrong. For the next two years Franklin’s internist sent her to infectious-disease doctors and endocrinologists; she found other experts on her own. Some attributed her symptoms to menopause; others said her thyroid was malfunctioning and prescribed varying amounts of medication to treat fluctuating episodes of underactive or overactive thyroid, which can occur when the gland is inflamed. But Franklin became increasingly convinced that her problem was tick-related, a belief that intensified when doctors seemed unable to pinpoint what was wrong or to prescribe effective treatment. “I thought I had chronic Lyme,” said Franklin, who became a Lyme disease activist. “I didn’t know where to turn and I went down that path for a long time.” The existence and treatment of “chronic Lyme disease” has been among the most contentious issues in medicine in recent years. Federal health officials have warned against the misleading diagnosis of the murky and ill-defined illness. And they have strongly cautioned against the unproven and dangerous remedies used to treat it. Chief among these is months or years of intravenous antibiotics prescribed by “Lyme literate” specialists, which in some cases have resulted in serious illness and even death. In July 2010, Franklin saw an ear, nose and throat specialist for episodes of vertigo and pulsatile tinnitus, a rhythmic whooshing or thumping sound that can signal a serious disorder. He ordered scans, which were normal, and ruled out an aneurysm or an abnormal tangle of blood vessels in the brain. The doctor told Franklin that her thyroid problem might be related to tinnitus; an overactive thyroid can cause a racing pulse and heart palpitations that could explain the sound that echoed in her ears. Another specialist worked Franklin up for a pheochromocytoma, a rare adrenal tumor that can cause sweating. Testing showed nothing abnormal. By 2011, Franklin had lost 22 pounds; at 5-foot-6 she weighed 118 pounds. Her primary care doctor was concerned and suggested she start drinking Ensure. “I remember bursting into tears in his office and begging for help,” she recalled. “I was flailing and he didn’t know what to do.” Her internist agreed to help her seek a consultation at a major Midwestern medical center, but was unable to secure an appointment. For the next five years she ping-ponged among Lyme practitioners, infectious-disease specialists, internists, and endocrinologists. Franklin said she typically mentioned Lyme disease at the beginning of a visit. Among the non-Lyme doctors, the reaction ranged from leery to downright chilly. An infectious-disease specialist in Cleveland told Franklin she thought her symptoms were related to menopause. A Philadelphia-area endocrinologist pronounced her perfectly healthy. Doctors in Delaware and New York suspected she might have mast cell activation syndrome, an allergic reaction that causes flushing, before ruling that out. The treatments prescribed by a trio of Lyme disease doctors, which included a three-week course of IV antibiotics that cost Franklin $9,000, did nothing to improve her health. The heart palpitations began in earnest in January 2017. Franklin mentioned them to an internist she was seeing for the first time, who brushed them off as anxiety. Because of her age, the doctor ordered a bone density test that revealed osteoporosis. By Sept. 21 the palpitations were impossible to ignore. “I had lunch and they didn’t go away,” Franklin recalled. Her husband took her to an urgent care center where the staff performed an electrocardiogram, then called an ambulance. Franklin was experiencing atrial fibrillation (AFib), an irregular, rapid heart rate. At the hospital she was started on medications to regulate her heart rate and prevent a stroke, which can occur as a result of AFib. A week later she was back in the hospital with a recurrence. This time an endocrinologist ordered a test for thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI), which Franklin said had not been performed previously. The result was definitive and so was the diagnosis: Franklin’s TSI level was sky high. Such an elevation is a hallmark of Graves’ disease, the most common cause of an overactive thyroid. Graves’ disease occurs when the immune system attacks the thyroid, causing it to produce too much thyroid hormone. This hormone controls the body’s use of energy and affects virtually every organ. The disease, named for 19th-century Irish physician Robert Graves, is believed to affect 1 in 200 people, the vast majority of them women. Its cause is unknown, but a combination of genes, reflected in a family history of thyroid disease, and an environmental trigger such as a virus or stress are thought to play a role. Symptoms of Graves’ include unintended weight loss, nervousness, palpitations, a racing pulse and heat intolerance. Some people develop an eye disease called Graves’ ophthalmology, which can cause bulging eyeballs, although Franklin was not among them. There are three ways to treat Graves’ disease: consumption of radioactive iodine, which decreases thyroid function; surgery to remove the gland; or medication. If left untreated, Graves’ can cause osteoporosis, AFib and sometimes heart failure. “Most people with new-onset AFib have their thyroid levels checked,” said Christopher Bruno, the endocrinologist who ordered the test and made the diagnosis. “Usually,” he added, “Graves’ disease is a pretty straightforward diagnosis.” In Franklin’s case, “she’d had workups for a lot of other things and she’d been seeing all these . . . specialists,” which may have contributed to the unusual delay. “I can’t say she walked around for a full decade, but she’d been walking around for a year or two” with undiagnosed Graves’ disease, he said, which caused AFib and possibly osteoporosis. Both Bruno and Franklin say they believe that her focus on Lyme disease may have been a factor. Bruno said that Franklin had asked him whether Lyme could have triggered Graves’ disease; he told her the two are unrelated. “They are two independent processes,” he said. Franklin said she now believes she consulted too many specialists, which proved to be confusing rather than clarifying. And she wishes she had not told new doctors what others had said or routinely shared her medical records. “They think, ‘Okay, some expert’s already looked at her, she’s a whiner,’ ” she said. She suspects that some physicians dismissed her as “a loony Lyme lady.” In retrospect she believes it would have been better to ask doctors, “What else could this be?” and to inquire about the next steps she should take. Franklin remains puzzled that despite her seesawing thyroid levels, none of the endocrinologists she consulted suggested she might have Graves. In 2018, after medication failed to stabilize her thyroid levels, Franklin underwent surgery to remove the gland, which led to a dramatic improvement in her health. She has not experienced a recurrence of AFib and her bone density has improved. “I don’t know that I’ll ever feel the way I used to,” she said. “It’s been a long road back.” Submit your solved medical mystery to sandra.boodman@washpost.com.

injecting urine into rabbits - The Washington Post", "author": "Gillian Brockell", "date": "7:00 a.m. EDT", "body": "Trying to figure out if you’re pregnant is probably as old as humanity itself. People had some pretty weird methods, like urinating on wheat and barley seeds (which kind of worked!), or mixing urine with wine for divination by a “wine prophet,” or shoving an onion into a patient’s vagina to see if it gave her bad breath. (This does NOT work, Gwyneth Paltrow. Do not recommend this.) These days, people who think they might be pregnant can pee on testing sticks that check for the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG). But nearly a century ago, when reliable HCG testing was being developed, it looked about as bizarre as the “wine prophet” and was so expensive only wealthy people could afford it. Over-the-counter pregnancy tests cost less now but still stretch some people’s budgets — especially if they want to take them regularly. With Texas’s abortion law essentially banning abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, early detection is more important than ever. Hormones were a relatively new concept to Western scientists in the 1920s, when gynecologists Selmar Aschheim and Bernhard Zondek were conducting research at a Berlin teaching hospital. According to a 1930 medical journal archived by the National Institutes of Health, the test they developed involved this: The urine of a possibly pregnant person was bottled and sent to a lab, where it was repeatedly injected subcutaneously into five female mice over five days. They were then killed and autopsied. If the mice had enlarged ovaries or signs of recently ovulating, then the test subject was pregnant, Aschheim and Zondek claimed. Not long after they developed the “AZ test,” their research ended abruptly when the men, both Jewish, were forced to flee Nazi Germany. By then, American doctor Maurice Friedman had adapted the test in the United States using a rabbit. He later bragged, “The only more reliable test is to wait nine months.” Justice Department will ask Supreme Court to block Texas abortion law while legal fights play out A test so involved was available only to the well-off, but soon tens of thousands of rabbits were being sacrificed in the name of science, and it quickly became a part of popular culture. Although rabbits were used for all manner of research, the “rabbit test” became synonymous with pregnancy screenings, and the phrase “the rabbit died” entered common usage as a euphemistic way of saying someone was pregnant (even though the rabbit always died during the test). The phrase appears in a noir thriller based on the 1947 unsolved murder of Elizabeth Short (“She forced herself to look squarely at him. ‘The rabbit died.’ ”), according to a compendium of historical slang, and in a 1967 gossip column to announce comedian Joan Rivers’s pregnancy. In her 1980 memoir about having 10 kids, humor writer Teresa Bloomingdale opened like this: In a 1978 episode of the hit TV series “M*A*S*H,” a female character worries she’s pregnant and threatens to kill another character’s pet rabbit to find out. Also in 1978, Billy Crystal made his big-screen debut in a movie co-written and directed by Rivers called “The Rabbit Test,” in which he portrayed “the world’s first pregnant man.” (You can find the truly ridiculous rabbit death scene on YouTube here; be forewarned the full clip contains a racial slur.) Dead rabbits may have spread across the fruited plain, but in the United Kingdom, a slightly more humane version was developed that involved injecting a frog with a patient’s urine. If the sample contained the pregnancy hormone, the frog would lay eggs within 24 hours, providing the key information without the need to kill the animal first. Plus, the frogs could be reused. By the 1970s, the rabbits lived. That’s when the first over-the-counter pregnancy tests became widely available.

As a 4½-foot, nearly 40-pound fish thrashed around in his boat, Smith called up a buddy and said, “I’ve got something weird here.” Smith sent him a photo, and the friend called back with an answer: That’s an alligator gar. “I’ve seen gar, but I ain’t never seen a gar with a head shaped like this,” Smith said in an interview, explaining that he first thought his catch may have been a flathead catfish. That’s because the alligator gar had never before been documented in the state. Smith got in touch with the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks, and the fisheries division confirmed it was an alligator gar, a type of fish whose fossil records it says trace back nearly 100 million years. It gets its name from its wide head and broad snouts that resemble an American alligator. Smith said that when he called the department, officials there were “just as shocked and surprised and stunned as I was.” His rare catch has set off a scramble to understand the origins of the fish and how it wound up in this water system. Biologists reeled in a 240-pound fish from the Detroit River that probably hatched a century ago Three gar species are native to Kansas, the longnose, shortnose and spotted gar. Before the alligator gar was confirmed, Smith posted a photo on a Facebook page for “whisker seekers,” a catfishing group. “A lot of people thought it was a spotted gar, or a shortnose. Some said alligator, but then people said they ain’t here,” Smith said. “And I said, ‘Well, there’s one here because it’s in the bottom of my boat.’ ” Doug Nygren, director of the fisheries division, said that in addition to its teeth — alligator gar have two rows of teeth — its size gave it away. While the longnose gar can get up to five feet or more, Nygren noted that “most of our native species are more slender.” The 39.5 pound fish that Smith caught weighed eight pounds more than the state record for a longnose gar, which, according to the department’s website, was caught in 1974. “My first reaction was: How did it get here?” Nygren said. The alligator gar is not native to Kansas and are instead found from southwestern Ohio and southeastern Missouri and Illinois south to the Gulf of Mexico, according to the Kansas Wildlife and Parks Department. Nygren said there are three ways his team is trying to determine its origin. If the fish had been from a nearby state, perhaps one with a program meant to restore native alligator gar populations, it would have been tagged. But no such tag was identified, he said, “so that took that option off the table.” The next step will be to send DNA samples and tissue from the fish to a genetic lab to “give us a clue as to what part of the country this fish may have come from.” The results may also help determine whether the fish came from an existing population in another state, according to the department. The third option is to utilize microchemistry. Bones from the head of the fish can help give the fisheries team a clue about how long it has been in the Neosho River by comparing the concentration of elements in the bone to the concentration in the water. “It’s going to be a while before we get all this information compiled,” Nygren said. Sean Lynott, a regional fisheries supervisor with the department, said the lack of a tag suggests “this fish was moved by man.” Nygren said the fish may have been introduced illegally into the river system, perhaps by someone who caught it in another state, or kept the fish as a pet and released it into the river when it got too big. According to the department, alligator gar can weigh more than 300 pounds and measure more than eight feet long. According to the department, it’s illegal to transport and release fish or other species in public waters, whether they are native or nonnative. “It may seem simple enough, ‘Oh, we’re just moving this fish from one river to another,’ ” Lynott said. “But you don’t know what you’re bringing in. We’re worried about disease that can be transported with the fish, we’re worried about aquatic nuisance species like zebra mussels that could be in the water with the fish. It’s just not a good idea to move fish around.” Nygren said the department does not consider the alligator gar an invasive species at this point, “but in general it’s not wise often to introduce nonnative species because of the unknown of what the impact could be on native species.” He said the department wants to learn as much as it can when a new species is recorded. “Sometimes it will help us craft a message on how to prevent it from happening again,” he said. Smith, who said he is a lifelong fisherman, said he hopes to catch something even bigger someday. “You spend enough time in the water, anything can happen,” he said.

On board were three astronauts — including the first woman to visit the station — headed on the nation’s longest crewed space mission yet. The Shenzhou-13 spacecraft — its name translates as “Divine Vessel” — took off from the Gobi Desert in northern China. Zhai Zhigang, who was chosen as mission commander for the six-month trip, graduated from China’s first group of astronaut trainees in the 1990s, the Reuters news agency reported. Selected from more than 1,500 potential astronaut candidates in 1998, Zhai, once a fighter pilot in the Chinese People’s Liberation Army, eventually conducted China’s first spacewalk. “After 13 years, I am going to set out for outer space again,” Zhai said to reporters. “I feel excited. I feel inspired. I also feel some pressure.” Wang Yaping, 41, is the first female astronaut to visit the Chinese station and the second Chinese woman to enter space. China has spent a decade working to develop technologies for a space station. Construction of the nation’s first permanent space station, Tiangong, started in April. It is slated to comprise three modules. One, called Tianhe or “Heavenly Harmony,” is just bigger than a city bus and serves as the main living quarters. Eleven missions will be needed to fully supply and complete the station. The six-month trip marks another step in the nation’s rapidly advancing space program. Three Chinese astronauts returned in September from a successful 90-day visit to the station, spending their time checking Tianhe’s life-support system, going on spacewalks and deploying the module’s robotic arm. The group also video-called Chinese leader Xi Jinping. The three-month trip marked China’s first crewed mission since 2016. “We will definitely encounter physical and psychological problems, as well as problems related to the equipment and facility,” Zhai told reporters Thursday. “Whether we can complete this flight mission well depends on our team, our tenacious will and the fighting spirit of our three crew members.” He added that the crew’s two years of training together gives them the “power and wisdom” to resolve all difficulties. Ahead of the launch, Beijing renewed a commitment to cooperate with the international peaceful use of space. Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian described sending people to space as a “common cause of mankind.” Zhao said China would “continue to extend the depth and breadth of international cooperation and exchanges” in spaceflight and “make positive contributions to the exploration of the mysteries of the universe.” The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.

Follow along for live updates. Washington Football Team (2-3) vs. Kansas City Chiefs (2-3) Kickoff: 1 p.m., FedEx Field TV: CBS Radio: 630, 980 AM; 105.9 FM Line: Kansas City -6.5 Tyreek Hill, bothered by a quad injury and held without a catch since the first quarter, had four grabs on Kansas City’s latest drive, including a two-yard touchdown pass from Patrick Mahomes that helped the Chiefs regain the lead. An offsides penalty on Montez Sweat three plays earlier gave Kansas City a second crack on third down after Washington had appeared to force a field goal attempt, and the Chiefs took advantage. (Kansas City 17, Washington 13, 4:07 left in the third quarter) Washington’s latest drive ended with a missed 42-yard field goal by Dustin Hopkins, who made both of his attempts in the first half. On the previous play, a third-and-two from the Kansas City 20-yard line, Adam Humphries was tackled for a loss of four on a screen pass. Washington is 6 for 11 on third down. (Washington 13, Kansas City 10, 8:25 left in the third quarter) Washington registered six hits against Patrick Mahomes in the first half, but only managed one sack. The unit doubled its sack total on the Chiefs’ first possession of the second half, when Chase Young dropped Mahomes for a loss of seven. Kansas City was eventually forced to punt. (Washington 13, Kansas City 10, 11:34 left in the third quarter) At halftime, Washington held a short ceremony to retire Sean Taylor’s No. 21 jersey and dedicate a road leading to FedEx Field after the legendary former safety. Taylor’s family, including father Pedro, daughter Jackie and girlfriend Jackie Garcia, attended as No. 21 and No. 36 jerseys dotted the stands. The celebration followed the recognition of former players, clustered by decades across the field, and came after the event was announced this week. If any fans in the stadium were frustrated with the lack of advanced notice, as many on social media were this week, it wasn’t apparent. “Sean is, and forever will be, an important part of our Washington Football Team family!” the public address announcer said to loud cheers. As the family walked off the field, fans began a brief chant: “Se-an Tay-lor! Se-an Tay-lor! Se-an Tay-lor!” The Chiefs moved quickly into Washington territory and were in position to at least tie the game with a field goal when a fumbled snap led to Kansas City’s third turnover of the half. Patrick Mahomes picked up the ball, but rather than take a sack, the quarterback attempted to throw as he was being taken to the ground. His wobbly toss was easily intercepted by Bobby McCain. Mahomes is 13 for 22 for 222 yards and two picks. The Chiefs will get the ball to start the second half. (Washington 13, Kansas City 10, halftime) Tight end Ricky Seals-Jones found himself wide open over the middle and hauled in a 39-yard touchdown catch from Taylor Heinicke to give Washington its first lead of the game. The key play on the drive was a 16-yard catch and run by JD McKissic on third-and-16 before the two-minute warning. Since starting the game 8 of 9 for 138 yards, Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes is 1 for 8 for seven yards and an interception. He’ll have a little more than a minute and all three timeouts to try to lead a scoring drive before halftime. Washington 13, Kansas City 10, 1:18 left in the second quarter) One play after Antonio Gibson had a 15-yard run for Washington’s longest play of the game, the running back lost a fumble that was recovered by defensive end Mike Danna at the Washington 34-yard line. The Chiefs failed to capitalize on their first takeaway since Week 2, as Mecole Hardman fumbled on an end-around three plays later and Kam Curl recovered at the Washington 33. (Kansas City 10, Washington 6, 4:50 left in the second quarter) After a nine-play drive during which Washington benefited from an unnecessary roughness penalty on linebacker Anthony Hitchens, the home team settled for Dustin Hopkins’s second field goal of the game. Taylor Heinicke threw well short of the line to gain on third-and-eight before Hopkins drilled a 43-yarder. Heinicke is 9 for 16 for 62 yards. (Kansas City 10, Washington 6, 8:07 left in the second quarter) After a 29-yard punt return by Mecole Hardman set the Chiefs up with excellent field position, Harrison Butker extended Kansas City’s lead to seven with a 52-yard field goal. Washington running back Antonio Gibson is questionable to return after aggravating the shin injury he’s been dealing with on the previous drive. (Kansas City 10, Washington 3, 12:33 left in the second quarter) Washington caught a break on the first play of the second quarter, when Patrick Mahomes’s pass intended for Tyreek Hill deflected off the wide receiver’s hands and into the arms of cornerback Kendall Fuller for an interception at the Washington 5-yard line. The Chiefs came into the game with the league’s second-worst turnover differential behind the Jaguars. The interception offered a bit of redemption for Fuller, who missed a tackle on Chiefs running back Jerick McKinnon on the previous play, which gave Kansas City a first down. (Kansas City 7, Washington 3, 14:55 left in the second quarter) Washington got on the board with a 50-yard field goal by Dustin Hopkins after a 12-play drive on its second possession. Rookie wide receiver Dyami Brown had a 13-yard catch on third-and-long to extend the march and was Taylor Heinicke’s intended target in the end zone on the third-down play that preceded Hopkins’s field goal, but Chiefs cornerback Rashad Fenton deflected the ball away. (Kansas City 7, Washington 3, 3:30 left in the first quarter) Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs carved up the Washington defense on Kansas City’s opening drive. Running back Darrel Williams, starting in place of the injured Clyde Edwards-Helaire, capped the 10-play, 95-yard march with a short touchdown run. Williams converted on a fourth-and-short near midfield earlier in the drive, while tight end Jody Fortson had a 27-yard catch over Landon Collins. Mahomes is 5 for 6 for 81 yards. (Kansas City 7, Washington 0, 9:09 left in the first quarter) Kansas City won the coin toss and elected to defer, giving Washington the ball first. Taylor Heinicke and Co. went three-and-out, sandwiching a couple of incompletions, including a deep shot that was just out of the grasp of wide receiver Terry McLaurin, around a short run by Antonio Gibson. The Chiefs will begin their first possession at their own 5-yard line after a booming 66-yard punt by Tress Way.

Reid looked down at his play sheet; a trip to the AFC championship game was on the line. “Knowing Andy, I wouldn’t put it past him to the throw the ball,” Rivera remembered saying to Stephanie, his wife. “Really?” she replied. “Would you [scheme against] him for that?” Passing was even riskier than usual. Kansas City’s star quarterback, Patrick Mahomes, was out because of a concussion. Reid could have given the ball to running back Darrel Williams, who was averaging six yards per carry, or backup Chad Henne, who had thrown 30 passes in the past six seasons — as well as an interception on the previous drive. “Probably not,” Rivera said. But then his mind drifted to Veterans Stadium, Sept. 12, 1999. Washington’s young roster is dealing with growing pains. That’s part of the plan. Rivera was a first-year linebackers coach under Reid, the Philadelphia Eagles’ rookie head coach. In their first game, the Eagles led the Arizona Cardinals 24-22 and faced third and four near midfield with two minutes to go. Everyone seemed to expect Reid to run, so he passed — and it almost worked. The receiver caught the ball but fumbled, and the Cardinals kicked a game-winning field goal as time expired. Twenty-two years later, as Henne rolled right — a pass! — Rivera shook his head. The call crystallized to him Reid’s daring and unpredictability, why it is so hard for even his former assistants to game-plan against him, which Rivera has done this week with the Washington Football Team hosting Kansas City on Sunday. Rivera and others from the 1999 Eagles’ staff, which produced eight head coaches and helped establish Reid as the NFL’s most influential modern coach, say decades of insight can mean little during games because Reid’s only true play-calling tendency is a lack of one. “That’s him,” Rivera said of Reid’s pass against Cleveland, which worked. Rivera imagined himself on the opposite sideline and wondered whether, in the never-ending game of “I know that you know that I know,” Reid would suspect he remembered Arizona in 1999. “If he sits there and says, ‘I think he knows I’m going to throw it, so I’ll run it.’ You just don’t know with him. That’s what keeps you guessing.” On Sunday, Rivera will be the third former assistant Reid has faced in this season’s first six weeks. Reid has fared well against them overall, with a 11-5 record, according to TruMedia, but he has lost both times this season, first to John Harbaugh’s Baltimore Ravens and last week to Sean McDermott’s Buffalo Bills. Rivera is 1-1 against Reid, and mutual friends joked Rivera should call Bills defensive coordinator Leslie Frazier, with whom Rivera played on the Chicago Bears, to ask the finer points of how he stifled Mahomes with two-deep zone coverages. “I’m proud of them,” Reid said of his coaching tree, even as it might be conspiring against him. “I don’t like getting beat by them, but I’m proud of them. It bothers me, period, losing games. I’m not big on it. But listen, they’re good coaches.” Washington to retire Sean Taylor’s jersey Sunday; team president apologizes for short notice In this way, Reid echoes Mike Holmgren, his mentor, doppelganger and link to pro football’s history as part of the Bill Walsh coaching tree. Holmgren coached Green Bay and Seattle and was the Reid of his generation. He thought of his former assistants as sons, particularly Reid, because, as he joked, “He copied my mustache, but mine’s a little neater.” Holmgren said players came to understand the tension he felt facing his guys, and some, such as Reggie White and Brett Favre, teased him for getting so uptight. “They said, ‘You’re acting a little weird,’ and I’d get mad. ‘No, I’m not!’ ” Holmgren remembered. “ ‘[They said]: ‘Yes, you are! Just admit it!’ ” If there’s one unifying theory among Reid’s assistants, it’s that his success has come from hard work and adaptability. He maintains the same routines year after year and blends innovative play-calling with superior talent. When facing him, Rivera paid close attention to personnel groupings — Reid believes in “players, not plays” as much as anyone — but knew his mentor self-scouted to avoid predictability. Brad Childress, who coached with Reid in Philadelphia and Kansas City, noted Reid has boxes of notes on his game card called “Get-you-going” plays. They’re specific calls to help Mahomes, if he falls out of rhythm, or to feed elite talents such as tight end Travis Kelce or wide receiver Tyreek Hill. “That’s the great thing about Andy,” Childress said. “He’s not a dinosaur. He may have come up in the dinosaur age, but he has changed every year, and he’s amenable to suggestions.” Sometimes, though, nothing works like an old favorite. In January 2008, Childress led the Minnesota Vikings against the Eagles in a wild-card game and knew his mentor would, at some point, use the slow screen. They had “overemphasized” it against early-down blitzes in Philadelphia because their quarterbacks, running backs and linemen excelled at the timing and feints necessary to sell it. Midway through the fourth quarter, holding a 16-14 lead, the Eagles had first and 10. Reid called the slow screen, and even without pressure, running back Brian Westbrook took it the distance. “In my wildest dreams, I didn’t think it was going to go for a [71]-yard touchdown,” Childress said, adding, with a laugh, “I kind of wanted to stick my foot out and trip Westbrook as he ran by me on the sideline.” Childress added what distinguishes Reid in the insular world of NFL coaching, what makes it hard to coach against him, is his innovation. In 2016, he had joined Reid in Kansas City, and they were scouting quarterbacks even though they didn’t plan to draft one. Reid was watching tape on North Dakota State quarterback Carson Wentz when he saw a play he liked, a creative one with three verticals to the short side and the running back going up the middle seam. He scribbled it on one of the 3-by-5-inch note cards he keeps on his desk. WFT offered money in exchange for public silence about workplace, former employees say In the spring, Kansas City tweaked the play’s elements to fit its personnel. Reid polished it in the preseason, and the week before the season opener against the defending champion New England Patriots, it made the game plan. Early in the fourth quarter, the Chiefs were deep in their own territory, trailing 27-21. Reid called “All Go HB Seam.” Running back Kareem Hunt beat the linebacker, and quarterback Alex Smith hit him in stride for a 78-yard touchdown. Kansas City took the lead to stay. Patriots Coach Bill Belichick could have watched every play Reid had ever run, been an assistant for years, and never seen it coming. “It was an unscouted look, a look they hadn’t seen,” Childress said. The challenge of beating a mentor, especially one as successful as Reid, is important to Rivera. He cherishes football legacy and history, and when he thinks about how he spends most of his time, he often sees Reid’s influence. The game will matter a little more to him Sunday. “It means something to me personally that I came up with Andy Reid, that he gave me my first chance,” Rivera said. “He basically put me on the road to where I am today.” What to know: • Washington to retire Sean Taylor’s No. 21 jersey before Sunday’s game • DeAndre Carter, playing for his late brother, has carved out a key role for Washington • WFT offered money in exchange for public silence about workplace, former employees say • NFL won’t release more from WFT investigation despite anger over offensive emails • Svrluga: Ron Rivera’s tenure has been an off-field maelstrom.

Washington Post", "author": "Chelsea Janes", "date": "12:02 a.m. EDT", "body": "ATLANTA — Stars form over time, as talent mixes with experience, with thousands of little lessons, with success and failure. Over time, they combine. Eventually, and sometimes unpredictably, they combust. As he galloped toward first base, having delivered his first-ever walk-off hit to give the Atlanta Braves a 3-2 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 1 of the National League Championship Series, Braves third baseman Austin Riley had long since been enveloped in a sudden season-long explosion. It was his fourth-inning homer that gave Atlanta their second run, or as many as starter Max Fried would allow the Dodgers in six hard-fought innings. And it was that line drive with Ozzie Albies on second in the bottom of the ninth that gave Atlanta a 1-0 lead in the first NLCS it has hosted in 20 years. “I think that kid is definitely taking the next step forward,” Braves Manager Brian Snitker said. Riley started sparking this time last year, when his ninth-inning hit spurred the Braves to a Game 1 win against the Dodgers. By the time he came up in a similar spot this year, Riley was a different player altogether, with even Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts saying the jump in the third baseman’s confidence was noticeable. “I’m just continuing to build that confidence of trusting my stuff and knowing that it plays at this level,” Riley said. In parts of two big league seasons before this one, Riley had never hit above .240. This year, he hit .303. He hit 33 homers, drove in 107 runs, and put together a .898 on-base-plus-slugging — two points higher than Braves superstar Freddie Freeman. On a night when Freeman struck out four times, Riley carried Atlanta as the crowd chanted “M-V-P.” “Crazy. Hats off to him. He’s come a long way in a short period of time,” Dodgers shortstop and Riley’s former NL East foe Trea Turner said. “There’s a reason why fans are cheering MVP for him.” Riley, or “the big boss” as Albies called him, is 7 for 17 with two homers in five postseason games this year, one of several younger Braves players who seem to be taking the next step. Game 1 starter Max Fried, for example, scattered eight hits over six innings and allowed just two runs despite admitting later he was fighting himself all night. He has allowed two runs in 12 postseason innings. “It just shows you how these guys are growing and they’re maturing, Snitker said. The moment isn’t too big for them because they’ve played in it now for three, four years.” That the Braves would be ready for the Dodgers is no surprise. Though the Dodgers have become staples of October, the Braves are trying to make this an annual thing, too: They’ve won four straight division titles. After losing to the Dodgers in seven games this time last year, they have yet to advance past the NLCS in that span. And in some ways, this didn’t seem likely to be the year they broke through. The Braves were the first National League team to win their division with fewer than 90 wins in nearly a decade and a half because played in the relatively weak NL East. The Dodgers were the first team to win 106 games and not win their division because they played in one of the best divisions in recent memory, the NL West. Everyone knew the Braves have spunk, panache, resilience and all that. They proved that this season when they lost MVP candidate Ronald Acuña Jr. to a torn ACL just before the all-star break, retooled at the deadline and came to life in time to win the division. They proved it last year when they pushed these Dodgers to a Game 7 in the NLCS. But here, in Cobb County, history looks different. Here, they’ll tell you it was the Dodgers who took the Braves to seven games, not the other way around. After all, Atlanta led that series 2-0, then 3-1, before losing three straight. “You look back and, you know what, we're capable of doing this,” Snitker said. “We played the world champions last year and were a game away from putting ourselves into the World Series.” They are three games away from a World Series now, three games in which they will face Max Scherzer, Walker Buehler, and Julio Urías — three games that would have looked far more formidable if Atlanta had not found a way to win this one. “It doesn’t get easier, that’s for darn sure,” Snitker said. “All these wins here in this thing are going to be big. They’re all going to be hard to come by.” In fact, as of the ninth inning, the game could have qualified as something near a best-case scenario for the Dodgers. They had left plenty of runners on, sure, but after being forced to rely on their bullpen for 27 outs, they were tied 2-2 with a chance to win the game. Their bullpen had struck out 13 batters. Their offense had put a man on in every inning but one. And in the top of the ninth, in particular, Chris Taylor had walked to put the go-ahead run on base. When Cody Bellinger singled behind him, they looked ready to strike. But Taylor rounded second base hard, then seemed to realize he had gone further than he might have normally. Instead of heading to third, he stopped, caught in between, and after a few back-and-forths ended up in a heap on the ground, tagged out, the inning over. “It’s kind of one of those where you got to pick,” Roberts said. “I think right there, he was kind of caught in between, and that’s kind of when you get in trouble.” Roberts’s Dodgers had plenty of other scoring chances. They left seven men on base and went 1 for 8 with runners in scoring position. Thanks to Riley, the Braves went 1 for 2 in those situations, and that was all they needed.

Nineteen games have been decided by a score in the final minute of regulation or overtime, the most through the first five weeks in NFL history. There have been 21 games decided by three points or fewer, and at least one game has gone to overtime each week. In Week 5, 13 games were within one score in the fourth quarter, and four teams (the Los Angeles Chargers, New England Patriots, Philadelphia Eagles and Baltimore Ravens) overcame deficits of at least 10 points to win. So what’s in store for Week 6? There are plenty of interesting matchups that could help continue the trend. NFL best bets and picks for Week 6: Take the Chiefs and Cowboys on the road All times Eastern. Byes: Falcons, Saints, Jets, 49ers Dolphins (1-4) vs. Jaguars (0-5) in London, 9:30 a.m., CBS Chiefs (2-3) at Washington Football Team (2-3), 1 p.m., CBS Chargers (4-1) at Ravens (4-1), 1 p.m., CBS Rams (4-1) at Giants (1-4), 1 p.m., Fox Texans (1-4) at Colts (1-4), 1 p.m., CBS Bengals (3-2) at Lions (0-5), 1 p.m., Fox Packers (4-1) at Bears (3-2), 1 p.m., Fox Vikings (2-3) at Panthers (3-2), 1 p.m., Fox Cardinals (5-0) at Browns (3-2), 4:05 p.m., Fox Raiders (3-2) at Broncos (3-2), 4:25 p.m., CBS Cowboys (4-1) at Patriots (2-3), 4:25 p.m., CBS Seahawks (2-3) at Steelers (2-3), 8:20 p.m., NBC Dolphins vs. Jaguars in London: Both teams will arrive at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on a losing streak: The Dolphins have lost four in a row, and the Jaguars have lost all five of their games this season and 20 straight dating from 2020. This is the second of two games in London this season, and the four teams involved are now a combined 4-16, something that might serve as a caveat to Frankfurt, Düsseldorf and Munich, the German cities in discussions to host regular season games in future seasons. The Jaguars, with Urban Meyer dreaming of an offense that passes for 250 yards and runs for another 250 (in the same game!), head into their bye after this game. Chargers at Ravens: Lamar Jackson or Justin Herbert? Who ya got? Certainly neither of their teams’ defenses in this one. Both quarterbacks have entered the MVP conversation, and it’s easy to see why. Jackson led Baltimore to a fourth-quarter comeback and overtime victory Monday night in which he completed 37 of 43 passes for 442 yards and four touchdowns. His 86 percent completion rate was the highest in NFL history among the 4,017 instances in which a quarterback has attempted at least 40 passes in a game. Herbert, meanwhile, has completed 77 of 119 passes for 901 yards and 11 touchdowns over his past three games. Last week, he passed for 398 yards and four touchdowns and rushed for another score as the Chargers beat the Browns in a wild fourth quarter in which 41 points were scored (with six touchdowns in a 12-minute span). Rams at Giants: The Rams are coming off a long-weekend mini-bye, while Daniel Jones and the Giants were battered in a loss to Dallas. Jones went into concussion protocol after a helmet-to-helmet hit left him wobbling off the field, but he is expected to play. If he can’t, Mike Glennon is his backup. Running back Saquon Barkley’s ankle injury and wide receiver Kenny Golladay’s knee injury are less serious than originally feared, but the status of both is uncertain. This is the second game of a six-game slog for the Giants, with Carolina, Kansas City, Las Vegas and Tampa Bay coming up before Thanksgiving. After a miss-filled Week 5, NFL kickers are on pace for a historically bad season Chiefs at Washington: Neither team really expected to be here after five games. And by here, we mean struggling with losing records. It certainly is more surprising for the Chiefs, who have advanced to the past three AFC championship games and gone 1-1 in Super Bowls in the Patrick Mahomes era. But their loss to Buffalo on Sunday night may have been a sign that the torch has been passed in the AFC. Kansas City’s offense was less dynamic than usual (Mahomes leads the NFL in touchdown passes but has been intercepted six times in the past four games after throwing six all of last season), and the defense has been a major issue. Washington’s defense, supposedly its strong point, has been a problem, too. During training camp, Chase Young, the 2020 defensive rookie of the year, and Montez Sweat spoke of aiming for the NFL’s sack record for a duo. They have a total of four through five games. Bills tighten grip on top spot in Week 6 power rankings as Cardinals move up Cardinals at Browns: Arizona, the last undefeated team, is 5-0 for the first time since 1974, and it will try to get to 6-0 without Coach Kliff Kingsbury, who was ruled out Friday night after a positive coronavirus test. Defensive coordinator Vance Joseph and assistant head coach/special teams coordinator Jeff Rodgers will share his duties. Even without its head coach, Arizona isn’t exactly what a Cleveland team coming off a heartbreaking loss to the Chargers wants to see. The Browns’ 47-42 loss to Los Angeles featured more than 1,000 yards of offense, 89 points and seven lead changes, but Herbert outdueled Baker Mayfield, whose left, non-throwing shoulder is injured. Raiders at Broncos: Life really does come at you fast, particularly in the NFL. Just a week ago, Jon Gruden was leading a 3-1 team into a game against Chicago. Las Vegas fell and then so did Gruden, whose departure put into question the team’s chances of capitalizing on its early-season success. Into the lurch steps interim coach Rich Bisaccia for an important AFC West game. Facing a team on uncertain footing after a coaching change might play into the hands of the Broncos, who have lost to Baltimore and Pittsburgh after a 3-0 start. The Broncos and Raiders have been slow to start on offense, and compounding the issue for the Raiders is that they will be facing the NFL’s third-best defense in yards allowed, with Von Miller racking up 4.5 sacks after missing all of last season with an injury. Beware the Broncos on fourth down, when Teddy Bridgewater has completed 7 of 8 passes for 95 yards and two touchdowns. Jon Gruden’s emails were jarring. To some in the NFL, they weren’t surprising. Seahawks at Steelers: This should have been another matchup of marquee quarterbacks. Alas, Russell Wilson is out, probably until Week 10, after having finger surgery, and Ben Roethlisberger has had an uneven season that has led to questions about whether he should be benched. However, Roethlisberger did throw multiple touchdown passes for the first time this season in last week’s victory over the Broncos. The Seahawks have never finished under .500 since Wilson’s arrival and have never finished last in the NFC West in the Wilson era. But for now the offense belongs to Geno Smith, who is accustomed to backing up durable quarterbacks such as Eli Manning, Philip Rivers and Wilson. He stepped in and completed 10 of 17 passes for 132 yards, with a touchdown and an interception, in a 26-17 loss to the Rams last week. Seattle’s defense may be a bigger issue after the Rams finished with 476 yards of offense. Scores | Stats | Standings | Teams | Transactions | Washington Football • Jon Gruden’s emails were jarring.

Spirit keep on winning - The Washington Post", "author": "Jake Lourim", "date": "1:22 a.m. EDT", "body": "The Washington Spirit players have refrained from addressing on-field matters the past two weeks, doing so again after Saturday’s 2-0 win against OL Reign in in Tacoma, Wash. And meanwhile, they saw one of the bigger off-field developments with Thursday’s report that controlling owner Steve Baldwin plans to sell the team. A sale would comply with the request the players made of Baldwin in an open letter Oct. 5. “We’re honestly still waiting on an update,” said Spirit midfielder Tori Huster, president of the National Women’s Soccer League Players Association. “It sounds like it’s going to require a little bit more time than we would like. But we want the process of a sale or whatever happens to proceed correctly, so we’re hoping that with the [NWSL] executive committee and the other board of governors that are overseeing the league right now, that they are really intentional about whatever ownership comes into the Washington Spirit.” On the field, the Spirit has reeled off three wins and a draw in the past 11 days, vaulting into third place in the league with one regular season match left. Asked how the team has navigated that stretch, with the added stress of leaguewide turmoil, interim coach Kris Ward said: “It’s a lot of planning, and then it’s also just listening. I know I talk about that a lot, but I kind of feel like that was missing. And I think that was across the league — just listen to these people. They’re smart. They know what they’ve been through.” Washington has all but secured a postseason berth. The Spirit can clinch its spot Sunday with a North Carolina loss to NJ/NY Gotham FC or a Houston loss to first-place Portland. Washington finishes the regular season Oct. 31 against the Dash. Washington’s perfect road trip this week came down to unlikely heroes coming through in unexpected moments. In the 70th minute Wednesday at North Carolina, first-year midfielder Julia Roddar’s first NWSL goal happened to put the Spirit ahead for good in a crucial 2-1 victory. And on Saturday, Washington rookie Taylor Aylmer broke through for Washington in the 22nd minute of her first career start. The assist came from Roddar, who sent a high, bouncing cross into the box and over the defense. Aylmer corralled the bounce and put a shot on target over the head of Reign goalie Sarah Bouhaddi, who was off her line. For insurance in the second half, the Spirit turned to its trusty star, as Ashley Hatch drilled a perfect shot from outside the box to beat Bouhaddi and push Washington’s lead to 2-0. Hatch leads the NWSL with 10 goals this season, moving out of a tie with the Reign’s Bethany Balcer and Houston’s Rachel Daly. Considering the opponent was a top-two team in the league, the Spirit didn’t have too much trouble putting away the win. Despite seven corners, the Reign managed only three shots on goal, and Washington’s Aubrey Bledsoe saved all of them. In the 78th minute, Sofia Huerta beat Washington’s Tegan McGrady to the end line and then slid a pass into the box, where Bledsoe dove to stop it. The rebound rolled to Eugénie Le Sommer, who took one touch but then sent it into the side netting. The Spirit came close to adding a third goal. Trinity Rodman had Bouhaddi beaten in the 62nd minute, but Reign midfielder Jessica Fishlock tore through the box, slid and knocked away Rodman’s shot just in time. Ashley Sanchez had a second chance from point-blank range but couldn’t get a shot off.

United settles for draw with Nashville - The Washington Post", "author": "Steven Goff", "date": "11:20 p.m. EDT", "body": "Time is running short on MLS’s regular season, and as D.C. United presses for a playoff berth in an overcrowded Eastern Conference, every match carries increasing weight. That is especially true at Audi Field, where Hernán Losada’s team has been very good this year and will spend most of its waning days. The first of two grand tests over five days at Audi Field came Saturday, and while United earned a point from the 0-0 draw with second-place Nashville SC, the outcome did not sit well with Losada or his squad. “We are not happy with the point,” the first-year coach said. “I am not happy with the point, especially at home. We are always playing to win, but in the end, it’s a point and we need to take it and try to stay positive and move forward.” It does not getting any easier: On Wednesday, the New England Revolution (20-4-6), MLS’s runaway leader in the Supporters’ Shield race for most points, comes to town. United (12-12-5) slipped one slot to sixth place in the conference, which will send seven teams to the postseason. But dropping points at home could prove costly for a team that, including Saturday’s game, will play four of its final six at home. “Of course, we don’t want to draw, but there are still points on the table, so we’re just going to keep rolling with the punches and playing every game like it’s the final,” defender Donovan Pines said. This result, before a season-high 18,034 spectators, extended United’s home unbeaten streak to five, but after four victories in which it scored 13 goals, D.C. was stuck in a 90-minute slog with defensively disciplined Nashville (11-3-15). It was shut out for the first time since July 31 in Cincinnati, a span of 13 matches. Nashville, Losada said, is “a team that’s hard to break. We knew it was a matter of efficiency and, if we see our chances, you need to put those opportunities in the back of the net if you want to win against a team like Nashville.” United did not generate many high-quality chances. Ola Kamara, who leads MLS in goals with 17, hit the post in the opening moments and was held scoreless for the fourth time in five matches. Saturday marked the start of five games in 15 days, a stretch that concerns Losada because of personnel issues. Washington Spirit owner Steve Baldwin says he plan to sell stake in club as NWSL fallout continues Since the previous game, a last-minute defeat in Orlando before the international break, Losada lost and gained players. Yordy Reyna, Edison Flores and Paul Arriola picked up injuries — the latter two while on national team duty — while Adrien Perez, Drew Skundrich and Ramón Ábila returned. Arriola, a key to United’s flank attack, started twice for the United States but hurt a groin muscle in pregame warm-ups Wednesday. United is hopeful he will miss only three matches and return Oct. 27 against the New York Red Bulls. Reyna (quadriceps) and Flores (calf) are on longer timetables. “I can’t manage because I don’t have enough numbers,” Losada said, adding that several starters and reserves are not fully healthy. “Now the games are coming one after each other, and I don’t have enough players to rotate, so many players will have to go through fatigue and not being 100 percent recovered. It’s just about being tough and strong enough to survive.” Blackistone: The NWSL is merely a symptom. U.S. Soccer is the problem. Perez was a welcome return after missing 15 matches with a broken foot. He started Saturday, but for fitness reasons, he played only one half. Defender Andy Najar also was limited to a half because of workload issues. Nashville rested three players who just returned from World Cup qualifiers: Costa Rican forward Randall Leal, Canadian defender Alistair Johnston and Panamanian midfielder Anibal Godoy. U.S. center back Walker Zimmerman started. United, seeking to avenge a 5-2 defeat in Tennessee in August, was on the prowl from the start. Aside from Kamara’s shot off the post, though, United labored to break down an organized resistance and promising buildups fizzled in the final third. Nashville was no threat until late in the game. United resorted to a clever set piece in the second half: Julian Gressel squared a free kick that Kamara dummied for Russell Canouse on the back side for a running blast that crashed into a defender. Canouse had two chances in the 65th minute, but former D.C. goalkeeper Joe Willis (13 shutouts) blocked his running header and stuffed his rebound bid. In the last 10 minutes, D.C. goalkeeper Bill Hamid (seven shutouts) thwarted Hany Mukhtar’s angled drive and Mukhtar set up Daniel Ríos for a low bid that narrowly missed the far corner. “It’s going to be close and tight until the end,” Losada said of the playoff race. “I am positive because no one believe in us at the beginning of the season.” Notes: Midfielder Moses Nyeman and forward Yamil Asad were not in uniform. Losada did not comment on the status of Asad, a veteran who has made only two appearances since early August. … The previous attendance high this season was 17,180 on Aug. 21 against Atlanta. … United has moved into a new training facility in Leesburg, ending a 20-year run at the RFK Stadium training grounds and other locations in and around the District. The NWSL’s Washington Spirit will eventually move into the 4,400-square-foot complex as well.

Way up on the Palouse in Pullman, Wash., the fluorescent yellow appeared in a stream, in one of the weirdest Gatorade showers in the long, trite history of Gatorade showers. It feted a 34-31 win on a touchdown with 90 seconds left that clinched no titles, sent the winner to 4-3 and the loser to 3-4, and did not qualify as a goose-bumpy upset. It rained upon Washington State Coach Nick Rolovich, who had just finished Game 11 of his two-season Cougar career, just getting going. Back down in the Great Smoky Mountains in Knoxville, Tenn., the fluorescent yellow appeared in a dot, in a practice-range golf ball Ole Miss Coach Lane Kiffin held up and claimed as a warped souvenir. It had joined the slew of items some Tennessee fans had hurled onto the field with 54 seconds left in a tight game, just after an unfavorable but accurate ruling on a fourth-down spot. The creepy deluge sent cheerleaders fleeing and included a container of mustard that was yellow but more of a standard yellow — and, if even partially full, wasted of the great gift to humanity that is mustard. College football winners and losers On a Saturday on which No. 2 Iowa had come back to Purdue-tinted earth and to 6-1 … and a stormy LSU up and beat Florida, 49-42, to quell any chitchat about whether Ed Orgeron, that head of one of the great national championships ever only 21 months ago, might continue coaching next week … Washington State players poured on Rolovich while there’s a chance he might not (continue coaching next week). That’s because the state of Washington has a public health mandate about state employees getting vaccinated, and Rolovich — the highest-paid state employee — remains unvaccinated, and there’s a deadline coming Monday when a committee may or may not get to Rolovich’s case in its pile of reviews of religious exemption requests. Now normally, American standards stay very clear on such situations. If there’s a question about a coach and that coach is 7-0, then the question subsides and even undergoes a mazy rationalization process. But in Washington state, the committee will work blindly, without knowing identities of subjects. Plus, these times are not normal as you may have heard and, besides, Rolovich has gone from 1-3 to 4-3, which makes things as translucent as all Gatorade. Just as it’s reasonable to assume the committee deliberations will not include any grousing about that season-opening loss to Utah State, it’s also reasonable to ask: Might the shower have come in homage to a farewell? A reasonable questioner did ask. “You think I set that up?” Rolovich said to the reporter. No, the reporter replied. “I don’t understand the question then,” said Rolovich, who then effused about his players and their life experience and said: “I’m going to come to work tomorrow and get ready for BYU. This is not in my hands.” Georgia’s defense actually gave up two touchdowns — not that it mattered Rolovich does work in America’s foremost religion, that of football, which fills sanctuaries like Neyland Stadium in Knoxville with impressive numbers of worshipers like the 102,455 of Saturday night. Long-starved for victory after a decade in the wildernesses of the standings of the 2010s, they had come following a sudden reawakening, the Volunteers’ thumping wins over Missouri (62-24) and South Carolina (45-20). Then they had roared through 59 hairy minutes with No. 13 Ole Miss. As the 60th began, and Mississippi led 31-26, and Tennessee faced fourth-and-24, quarterback Hendon Hooker threw to tight end Jacob Warren and gained 23, leading to a spot and a review of that spot. The verdict left some witnesses certain enough of doom to throw stuff, apparently oblivious to the fact that the Volunteers retained their timeouts and Ole Miss might just respond with one of the worst time-killing drives in human history, which it did. Soon Tennessee’s Velus Jones Jr. fielded a punt and surged up the right sideline thrillingly for 40 yards and darned-near full-on glory, and the Volunteers stood 47 yards from victory with 27 seconds left. They got to the 21 while Hooker, who transferred from Virginia Tech, got hurt, and Joe Milton III, who transferred from Michigan, got in, but then Milton lost track of time and ran out of bounds at the Ole Miss 8-yard line to close matters. That left Kiffin, who once coached that season at Tennessee (2009) before abandoning it for Southern California, to make what looked like a fine catch of a flying plastic something on his walk out, and to address the matter with the rare value he offers to the sport at large: humor. He spoke of seeing projectiles “filled with some brown stuff,” while reckoning, “I don’t think they’d waste moonshine on me.” It also left Tennessee and the SEC to hit the boardrooms and address the matter in the coming days, with the SEC already issuing a statement that “under no circumstances is it acceptable to endanger the contest participants and disrupt a game.” It was is an opportune time to remember that the United Kingdom snuffed out its hooligan malaise of the late 20th century with such tactics as full-crowd videotaping and lifetime stadium bans for misbehavior. Meanwhile, as usual, there are decisions to be made indoors, while the remedy for the dreariness of those decisions will come outdoors, in the coming football games. Eleven teams remain unbeaten, six in the Power Five, unless you want to count unbeaten Cincinnati, the Group of Five monster with the No. 3 ranking. It’s a testament to the Bearcats’ fresh prominence that their 56-21 ravaging of UCF counted as an afterthought. Michigan State has gone to 7-0 and Michigan could follow against Northwestern next Saturday, meaning the two of them would make quite a Halloween accentuation in East Lansing on Oct. 30. Both Oklahoma Big 12 teams remain unbeaten, and Oklahoma State has just gone to Austin and sent Texas into further reel if not to disbanding of football operations, and Georgia looks better than everybody, with a reminder that Alabama has not disbanded football operations even with that one loss of Oct. 9. ‘College kickers’ is a familiar Saturday refrain, but for family it’s nothing but tension And, in the grand recent Pac-12, tradition, that league of pretty topography and crazy football has gone full parity, the kind that prevents College Football Playoff berths, of which the league had none the last four seasons. Arizona State looked like a candidate and stood 5-1 and led 21-7 at halftime at Utah, but trailed 35-21 by the end after a quarterback with a sterling name, Cameron Rising, led drives of 75, 68, 67 and 82 yards, the Utes going 4-for-4 on second-half possessions. UCLA looked promising early but then lost to Fresno State and Arizona State, and Arizona State looked promising but then lost to Utah, and Utah looks promising but has those losses to BYU and San Diego State, the latter 33-31 in three overtimes on Sept. 18. Oregon looked mighty promising in upsetting Ohio State on Sept. 11, but then lost at Stanford, which looked promising but then lost to Arizona State, leaving Oregon State atop the Pac-12 North until it lost on Oct. 9 to Washington State, whose head coach might have to depart midseason with a three-game winning streak. Now Oregon (5-1) will go play UCLA (5-2) this coming Saturday in the Rose Bowl, where the Rose Bowl sunlight is a recuperative yellow.

"CHICAGO — Fifteen hours after the Chicago Sky took a 2-1 lead in the WNBA Finals, the scoreboards remained on inside Wintrust Arena. The most lopsided score in Finals history — 86-50 — remained lit in bright white lights as if the operator was waiting for Kahleah Copper to score again. The Chicago Sky’s star forward dropped 22 points, including 20 in the first half, in just under 24 minutes as her nearly waist-length ponytail was basically a blur, the tail of a comet blowing past Phoenix Mercury defenders. One of the biggest story lines coming into the Finals was the return of two-time MVP Candace Parker to the Finals, trying to bring her hometown of Chicago its first WNBA championship. Copper has rewritten that narrative with the Sky seeking to close out the series Sunday. “Hopefully, she doesn’t show up to the gym. That’d be nice,” cracked Mercury guard Diana Taurasi, a three-time champion. “The kid’s playing really, really well. She’s been playing well for a long time now, going back to the bubble. I was at USA camp with her, and she was unbelievable there, too. I mean, the kid’s just really, really good. “We have to make sure we make it a team effort. It’s not the person guarding her, it’s everyone behind her, and we have to do a better job of that.” Skylar Diggins-Smith, chasing her first WNBA title, cranks up her legendary focus Copper picked the perfect time to be playing the best basketball of her six-year WNBA career. She earned her first all-star appearance in the summer, helped lead her team to the Finals and is the third-highest scorer in the postseason (18.6 points) among those who played more than one game. The Philadelphia product by way of Rutgers has always had lofty aspirations, but this run may have exceeded them. “It's definitely catching me off guard,” Copper said. “Dreams of playing in the WNBA for me didn't come until late. But getting here? Yeah, I wanted to win a championship, but like my younger self [picturing all this]? No, no.” The journey has been far from direct. Drafted in the first round by the Washington Mystics in 2016, she got word she was traded to Chicago while playing overseas after her rookie season. That was a quick lesson in the business of professional basketball. The silver lining was being part of a deal for MVP Elena Delle Donne. Mystics General Manager and Coach Mike Thibault didn’t want to include her in the trade, but Chicago asked for Copper at the 11th hour, and Thibault pulled the trigger. “We were dying not to give her in the trade,” Thibault said. “We resisted, and it’s finally what we had to settle on to do it. A good trade is one that benefits both teams. We got our championship out of the trade, and they may get theirs out of it. “I keep saying to myself, I wish they would have never asked. Our heart sank when they finally asked for her in the deal. We thought we were kind of home free.” WNBA eyes expansion and changes to playoff format Thibault said he has long had a special affinity for Rutgers players because they usually come into the league well prepared, especially on the defensive end. He said they seem to blossom offensively in the league and he remembers that Copper wasn’t a great outside shooter but was determined to get better. Now she’s shooting 53.5 percent from the field and 39.3 percent from behind the arc in the playoffs. Rutgers assistant coach Michelle Edwards noted that Copper was special from the day she stepped on campus in New Jersey. The natural athleticism and talent were one thing, but she also had a desire to learn and be coached. Copper was actually a power forward when she first joined the Scarlet Knights, but Coach C. Vivian Stringer said she’d need to work on her guard skills to play at the next level. Now opponents can’t stay in front of her on the perimeter and her energy and aggression are relentless. “Kahleah never took a play off in practice, in the game, always full of energy,” Edwards said. “And just loved the game. That’s something special. She had that 'it’ factor because everyone doesn’t have it, as we all know. You hear professional athletes talk about that all the time, but Kahleah is certainly one that did have the ‘it’ factor.” Copper credits her Philadelphia roots for that mind-set. She plays with an edge, as evidenced by a play in Game 2 when Copper and Sophie Cunningham collided while going after a loose ball. Cunningham tried to snatch the ball away after the whistle. Copper wasn’t having it. She hopped and got in Cunningham’s face with a few select words before an official and teammate Courtney Vandersloot guided her away. “I’m going to say it like this: She ain’t no punk,” Edwards said with a laugh. “She. Aint. No. Punk. “At Rutgers, you’ve got to be tough, man. … She’s a sweetheart, but at the same time, she’s no pushover.” The Mercury has learned this during the first three games. Coach Sandy Brondello acknowledged, “we can’t stop everything,” but they hope to guide her toward the help defense when driving instead of letting her get to the rim. Brondello wants Copper to shoot from the outside, but nights such as Friday happen when she’s both knocking down three-pointers and beating defenders off the dribble. Sky Coach James Wade said none of this is a surprise. “Now she’s letting the world know,” Wade said. “It’s just who she is.” Read more on basketball: Diana Taurasi, Brittney Griner and Candace Parker bring star power to WNBA Finals Maryland women’s basketball has all its starters back and one goal — a national title Male practice players returned to the WNBA after a pandemic-enforced absence The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.

The mother of three from Fanwood, N.J., had seen her dream of someday owning a storefront bakery slip away. Rabello started a cookie company a few years back, and then the rent for the commercial kitchen she needed to legally produce the treats she once sold to neighbors and friends eventually became too much for her to justify. But last week, new regulations took effect in New Jersey allowing home bakers to sell their wares. It is the last state in the country to give up its ban on “cottage food,” products such as baked goods and jams made in home kitchens and sold at farmers markets and by hand delivery, and advertised though online portals, social media or simply word of mouth. Now Rabello, who hopes to build up her business at home before setting up a bricks-and-mortar shop, is planning to use her kitchen to produce her signature cookies in two flavors that she says are designed to pair well with a cup of espresso: one with cornmeal and fennel seeds, inspired by cakes her grandmother made when she was growing up in Brazil; and another with espresso and dark chocolate. “I have everything all planned out in my head,” Rabello says. Cookie recipes to suit every taste Cooks like her across the country are increasingly taking advantage of loosening laws allowing them to make and sell baked goods — from cupcakes to cocoa bombs — from their homes. While every state has dropped its outright ban on such businesses, many still have varying levels of restrictions. Some require permits or food-safety training, and many set caps on how much income a home cook can bring in. The pandemic accelerated the trend toward deregulation of all kinds of homemade-food sales. Amid lockdowns, many people were out of work, particularly in the restaurant business, and looking for ways to make a little cash. And consumers, wary of supermarkets and restaurants, embraced delivery and takeout like never before. In New Jersey, regulators had come under pressure by a lawsuit from the New Jersey Home Bakers Association, of which Rabello is a member. Elsewhere over the past year, a dozen other states loosened laws on sales of home cooking. Those ranged from modest moves in Arkansas, which expanded the kinds of shelf-stable foods people could sell and permitted them to sell online and to retailers, to more sweeping changes in such states as Montana, which now allows people to sell almost all kinds of foods and meals — with the exception of certain meats — directly to consumers. Venison is the most eco-friendly food on the planet — if you hunt the deer yourself The rollback of such restrictions across the country is due in part to the disparate political forces that it brings together. “I think that’s the magic sauce that has gotten a lot of these bills passed,” says Emily Broad Leib, deputy director of the Center for Health Law and Policy Innovation at Harvard Law School. “It’s a unique opportunity to cut across traditional lines.” Many of the legal challenges to various regulations and statutes have been brought by the Institute for Justice, a libertarian-leaning law firm. In addition to small-government advocates, the effort to allow more sales of home-cooked fare draws support from more liberal people because of its emphasis on helping women, particularly low-income, minority and immigrant women. Women make up 83 percent of cottage-food-makers, according to a 2018 survey by the Institute for Justice, which also found that the demographics skewed to low-income women living in rural areas. Rabello’s story helps explain why the cottage food industry appeals to so many women, who are disproportionately responsible for child-care and housekeeping duties. She plans to bake while her kids are at school or at night after their bedtimes, she says. “There’s nothing like an empty kitchen,” she says. That’s the kind of flexibility she didn’t have at the commercial space she rented — many rentals offer cooks set hours when they can access the space. Get Voraciously’s Baking Basics newsletter and learn the techniques that make baking a piece of cake Many of the women Rabello met through the bakers’ association and its lobbying efforts — the group had also pushed for a bill in the state legislature, but it stalled — were in similar need of a more accommodating setup, she says. “So many people just needed to supplement their income for a while, maybe for a prescription,” Rabello says. “Some were disabled and could only work from home. Some were military spouses.” And some advocates want to push further, making it legal for home cooks to not only produce and sell baked goods, but full meals as well. That’s legal in a handful of states: Montana, Utah, Wyoming, Oklahoma and North Dakota allow some kinds of these sales. And last year, California adopted a law allowing counties to opt in to legal home-food sales. So far, a number of districts, including the city of Berkley and Alameda County, Calif., have legalized them. Erica Smith Ewing is a senior attorney for the Institute for Justice, which is overseeing lobbying and litigation in a number of states aimed at allowing what the group calls full “food freedom.” Ewing says that the pandemic experience of loosening food laws underscores the economic empowerment it offers. “We’re seeing that this is a huge opportunity for people to support themselves and their families and their farms,” she says. “It’s what people want and it’s what they need.” Alvin Salehi, a co-founder of the Shef, an online platform for home cooks, also sees this as a moment to seize. He calls the passage of the new rules in New Jersey, and the fact that cottage food sales are legal in all 50 states, “an inflection point.” “It’s a signal that a shift to making income at home is here to stay,” he says. And now that all states have some kind of regulatory framework for at-home cooking, the question, he says, is simple. “Now it’s just a matter of, can we adjust and update them to be more permissive to enable people to cook more foods from home?” His company — which functions a little like Uber for people looking to sell homemade food — operates differently in the different markets it serves. In some areas, sales of home-cooked foods are allowed, and in others, Shef offers cooks access to commercial kitchens to prepare their meals. Staff picks: 8 condiments we swear by and how to use them Not everyone is onboard with such changes, though. Local health departments and traditional food retailers have often been wary of proposed changes. In New Jersey, a group of grocers complained to regulators that cottage food makers would be operating under different standards than they do. But home cooks have long contended that their food — the kind they’ve always served friends and neighbors and offered at bake sales and school events — is safe. And advocates say the small businesses aren’t a meaningful threat to existing venues. And some note that with the proliferation of online platforms that allow people to market and sell all kinds of goods and services, such as Facebook Marketplace, Nextdoor and Instagram, home cooks are already selling their wares, whether it’s legal or not. Broad Leib says public officials aren’t necessarily creating new markets when they legalize more home-food sales, they’re just getting ahead of the curve: “In a lot of places,” she says, “legislators and regulators are thinking, ‘how much of this is going on anyway, so we might as well put in place guardrails.’ ” More from Voraciously: Padma Lakshmi has a new kids’ book — and a fresh pandemic perspective Truffles, gold leaf and triple-digit prices: Status dishes are back Sorel liquor is back, with a big investor and a goal to help lift up more Black distillers Never ask what's for dinner again.

"Hubert Germain, who died Oct. 12 at age 101, was the last survivor of 1,038 French soldiers and resistance fighters decorated as “Companions of the Liberation” by their wartime leader (and future French president) Gen. Charles de Gaulle for their role in freeing France from German occupation during World War II. Mr. Germain died at a hospital and care facility for war veterans in Paris, his home city. His death was announced by French Defense Minister Florence Parly. No specific cause of death was mentioned. The members of the resistance who fought the Nazis inside their occupied homeland as rural and urban guerrillas were known as the “maquis,” named after the underbrush that often served as their cover. They became the French Forces of the Interior (FFI). Mr. Germain, on the other hand, did much of his fighting outside his country as part of the Free French Forces (FFL in the French abbreviation). He fought alongside U.S., British and other Allied forces in Libya, Egypt, Tunisia and Italy, where he was wounded. He had fled France for London in June 1940, inspired by de Gaulle’s famous June 18 “Appel” — call or summons — over BBC radio, urging French resistance to the German occupation. Mr. Germain was disgusted that the new French prime minister, Marshal Philippe Pétain, had declared an “armistice” with Adolf Hitler that was effectively the same as a surrender. Mr. Germain initially joined the French Foreign Legion, but when some legionnaires — many of whom were not French — sided with the Germans or Pétain’s collaborationist regime, he and others became part of de Gaulle’s Free French Forces. He first saw action in May and June 1942 as commander of an antitank unit in a fierce battle at Bir-Hakeim, an oasis in the Libyan desert near Tobruk. He fought alongside the British Eighth Army against the mighty Afrika Korps of German Gen. Erwin Rommel, the “Desert Fox.” The French were ultimately forced to retreat after waves of attacks by Luftwaffe Stuka dive-bombers. “Outnumbered 10 to one, the French held off Rommel’s forces and delayed their offensive, allowing the British to reestablish themselves at El Alamein [Egypt],” wrote French war historian Dominique Lormier. Historians estimate that 141 French forces were killed at Bir-Hakeim, 229 were wounded and more than 800 were taken prisoner. But Rommel’s forces sustained greater losses, with 3,300 troops killed or wounded and 227 captured. “In the whole course of the desert war,” German Maj. Gen. Friedrich von Mellenthin later wrote of the French, “we never encountered a more heroic and well-sustained defense.” As a lieutenant in the Free French Forces, Mr. Germain went on to fight at El Alamein and in Tunisia before taking part in the Allied invasion of Italy in 1944. Commanding a French antitank unit, he was wounded and later received a commendation from de Gaulle. Within a month, Mr. Germain was back in combat as part of Operation Dragoon, which was originally planned to divert German forces in southern France on June 6, 1944, when Allied forces were coming ashore during the D-Day landings in Normandy, in northern France. Operation Dragoon was delayed by logistical problems, and Mr. Germain finally landed on a beach of his homeland on Aug. 15. “I fell into the sand and cried like a baby . . . I had returned to my country,” he told Agence France-Presse in 2017. He then helped liberate the city of Toulon, the Rhone valley and the city of Lyon. In April 1945, he and his Free French joined with British forces in the Battle of Authion, in the French Alps, driving the Germans off their mountaintop fortress and opening up a strategic route between France and Italy. It effectively marked the end of the war in France, and within a month Germany had surrendered to the Allies. Hubert Jean Louis Germain was born in Paris on Aug. 6, 1920. His father was a general in France’s colonial army. Mr. Germain attended a bilingual French-Arabic school in Damascus, Syria, then under French mandate, before moving to a French school in Hanoi. He completed his education in Paris. In June 1940, he was taking an exam to qualify for a French naval school when he learned that Hitler’s advancing forces were headed for Paris, and the French government was planning to surrender. In his 2017 interview with AFP, Mr. Germain recalled walking up to his naval examiner, five minutes into the test, handing him a blank piece of paper and saying, “It’s useless to go any further with this. I’m leaving for the war.” When he found out that thousands of Polish soldiers were trying to get to England to fight the Germans, he joined them aboard the SS Arandora Star, a British ocean liner commandeered as a troopship. They landed in Liverpool on June 24, 1940. (Eight days later, the Arandora Star was sunk by a German U-boat off the coast of Ireland, with the loss of 805 passengers and crew.) Mr. Germain, who was almost 6 feet, 3 inches tall, soon met the exiled de Gaulle in London. “He stopped for a second, looked at me and said, ‘I am going to need you,’ ” Mr. Germain recalled to AFP. “When, as 19-year-old, you get that in the face, amid a general disaster, it is something that moves you deeply.” He said he “found a father figure” in de Gaulle and “immediately got into the war.” After Germany’s surrender in 1945, Mr. Germain served as an aide-de-camp to Gen. Pierre Koenig, commander of the French-occupied zone in Germany. He married Simone Millon in October 1945, and they went on to have three children. Details of his survivors were not immediately known. Mr. Germain worked for a chemicals company for several years before becoming mayor of Saint-Chéron, southwest of Paris, from 1953 to 1965. He was a Gaullist member of the French parliament and went on to serve as France’s postal service and telecommunications minister from 1972 to 1974 in the government of Georges Pompidou. He later ran a jewelry shop in Paris before he retired. Mr. Germain will be buried on Nov. 11, France’s Armistice Day, in a crypt at the Mont-Valérien fort west of Paris. De Gaulle selected it as a national memorial site for its symbolic importance because it was used by Nazi occupiers to put more than 1,000 members of the resistance and others before the firing squad. (There is also an American military cemetery on the site.) In June 2020, to mark the 80th anniversary of de Gaulle’s historic BBC “Appel,” Britain named Mr. Germain an honorary Member of the British Empire (MBE) for his bravery alongside British troops during the war. The Times of London quoted Mr. Germain as saying he regretted telling his troops in Alsace to use the frozen bodies of dead German soldiers as steps into a building he needed as a watch post. He also lived and died with the guilt of taking so many lives as a soldier. “I am a Christian, but I killed people,” he said not long before he died, according to the Times. “It still bothers me today.” \n Read more Washington Post obituaries The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.

Youngest and last one at home has told us regularly we don’t have to come and indicates she wants more space. But when we do something without her, she gets mad. This weekend we’re only attending three of the six games of a two-day tournament and doing something else we enjoy instead, and she’s pouting. I’d actually rather spend the whole weekend watching her play, but thought she didn’t want that. Argh. — Can’t Win Can’t Win: Until she’s able to articulate what she wants, stick to making decisions for you that don’t require anything of her. Meaning, any time you lack clear kidly guidance, make your own plans based on what you want to do, and let her make hers. (I’m assuming a teenager here.) In this case, that would mean going to as many games as you want, because you want to. If she wants to interact with you there, great; if she doesn't, then you go, rah rah, leave. When she says you don't “have to” come, say, “Thanks, that's good to know. If you'd rather I didn't, just say so — no hard feelings. Otherwise, I plan to go because I want to be there.” The, “because I want to,” relieves her of the burden of thinking for two. That's a lot of pressure on a kid, especially once she's old enough to grasp that her performance is your weekend plan. Yikes. (Something an 8-year-old barely considers, right?) And if your presence is more than she wants to carry, then you've made it easier for her to say, “I'd actually rather you didn't come,” or, “How bout half the games?” Your permission to be excluded hands her those words. This all may seem extremely literal. Exactly! That's the point. She's having trouble drawing clear boundaries — good for her, she's trying — and that's what adolescence is for. So do your part to uncomplicate her boundaries by drawing yours kindly and clearly. It both sets an example and hands her a paint-by-numbers for how to respond. This is not a way to “win,” by the way — because she hasn’t figured this all out any more than you have, so you’ll both get stuff wrong. But being literal, transparent and (oh my goodness) brief plants you right where she can see you, no guesswork necessary, and frees her up to worry about other things. Dear Carolyn: I’m getting married next month. The wedding is in person but small and outdoors. We have worked hard to plan it and are really excited to celebrate with our family and friends! So I was very dismayed to receive a number of “no” RSVPs from a certain cluster of folks from my fiance's side. All are vaccinated. Then I was at a family picnic last weekend and overheard some people talking about the wedding. One of the Nos told my fiance’s mom (pretty flippantly) that she is not making the effort to come because my fiance and I are not planning to have children together, a fact we have shared openly. She says others in that cluster have made a similar decision. I don’t quite know what to make of this, or to say or do about it. Do people not think it counts as a “real” wedding if it’s not a prelude to starting a “real” family? If I had known our decision not to have kids would cost us wedding guests, maybe we would have kept it to ourselves. — Dismayed Dismayed: Imagine the patience and resilience you’d need, though, to deflect this bunch of boundary-tramplers: “My what a personal question,” “Why do you ask?” “Are you offering to raise them?” “Interesting,” “Bless your heart.” At least now it’s said and done and you aren’t wasting a bundle per head to feed them. To answer your question, I can't say what “people” think — but clearly these people do indeed have arbitrary definitions of what parts of others' lives are “real,” and weaponize their RSVPs accordingly. Bless them for it, I say. Around here we call that an addition by subtraction. That is, assuming you heard them correctly. Just to cover the possibility of misunderstanding, consider asking your fiance, his mom, or the opter-outer herself what she meant. Because what you overheard is pretty seriously weird, for one thing, which alone makes it worth verifying — and also because it helps to counteract anger with skepticism. You want your decisions to come from the best information available, and the best way to get that, typically, is to ask. Still, that’s just some t-crossing. People who aren’t thrilled to be at your wedding, for whatever reason, are the ones you don’t really want there anyway, grabbing at canapés and begrudging their way through your careful hospitality. My warmest congratulations to you both.

I have four children — also grown and out of the home. Steve's marriage was over before I met him. Steve and I operate a small but very successful business together. Here's the problem: Steve's 19-year-old daughter works for us. She gets paid for 40 hours a week, even though she works only 25 hours, at most. Steve makes sure her phone is paid for, has bought her a very expensive laptop and has bought her a brand-new luxury model car. (She now expects a new one.) We pay her health insurance. She lives in her boyfriend's house. Her boyfriend's parents own the house, and her rent is way below market price. If I bring up to Steve that I think we help her way too much, I'm the bad guy. Am I wrong in not wanting to help her so much? I also need to add that I do not get a paycheck, nor do I have any money unless I ask Steve for it. All while his daughter constantly tells her father that she won't do anything for him. I am just now putting my foot down about being brought into all decisions being made. I love him and want to stay, but am I just wasting my remaining happy years on nothing? — Marred in Maine Marred in Maine: You criticize “Steve’s” daughter for being entirely dependent on her father, and yet you are, too. The difference between you and this young woman is she is not working hard but is receiving compensation; you are working hard — but are not getting paid. You might ask her for tips on how to pry a paycheck out of her father. Steve’s daughter comes first. If she is entitled and spoiled, then he helped to create this monster, and a monster she will remain — at least for the next few years. Many small businesses rely on family members to provide hours of free labor, but according to you, the business you and Steve operate is successful. Your choice to work without pay is a true head-scratcher. If one of your adult children described a situation where they were deeply ensconced in a personal and business relationship identical to yours, what advice would you give? My point is that you should take a long and careful look at your own situation and ask yourself if you are with someone who is controlling the women in his life through money. Dear Amy: Recently, my family and I attended a church that was not our home parish, and we did not know the members. The family in front of me was sitting on their pew as I knelt from behind. The position I was in gave me a close-up view of the blond long-haired teenage girl sitting directly below my gaze. She clearly had two lice nits affixed to her hair (shining from the bright overhead lights). In my experience as a teacher for 37 years, I have encountered this situation numerous times, but on those occasions, I had sent the child to the nurse without having to discuss the reason (a phone call was made to the nurse before child's arrival). I would never intentionally embarrass someone or bring something unpleasantly personal to their attention. Yes, lice tend to visit \"clean hair,\" but that doesn't help to alleviate the discomfort of it. I chose to say nothing, and now I wonder if I should have vocalized the information. There were five other long-haired girls in the family, and my concern now is that they might become infected, also. What would you have done? — Second Guessing My Silence Second Guessing My Silence: I wouldn’t have done anything. If you were a dermatologist and noticed a potentially serious growth on the back of a head in the pew in front of you (located in a place where a person couldn’t see it), then you should speak up. But nits don’t necessarily become lice. And lice aren’t a serious threat to life and limb (as you know). Dear Amy: Thank you for sticking up for the teenager who brought his \"lovey\" to his grandmother's house \"Embarrassed Gran.\" I am a married dad, and I've had my stuffed panda in my room since, well, since forever. I guess this goes against the grain, gender-wise, but I'm cool with it, and my kids seem to feel the same way. — Secure Secure: It seems that your panda has done a very good job. 2021 by Amy Dickinson distributed by Tribune Content Agency The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.

I am grateful that I am alive, but I am struggling with comments regarding my hair. My hair was one of my best features. It was a beautiful color and texture, and I received compliments often. Now, I don't know what to say when people comment on my very short hair. I have a wig, but it's tedious to make sure it's on correctly and is very uncomfortable on hot days. I know my hair will grow back and that a good stylist can restore it to its former beauty, but in the meantime, the questions and comments sting. I don't know how to respond. “I had something done” — leaving it purposely ambiguous whether it was for health or aesthetic reasons. Sadly, suggesting that it was a fashion choice will probably garner less follow-up than the more personal question of your health. But perhaps Miss Manners may be underestimating human nosiness even in that. Dear Miss Manners: A woman is dating a man, and they are out to dinner with his family (14 people). A birthday cake (brought in from outside) is served. She doesn't want the cake and orders sorbet for dessert instead. Was that rude of her? Yes. But before you subject Miss Manners to all of the obvious and angry objections (she was on a diet, vegan, gluten-free, frosting-averse, etc., etc.), she is not saying that the cake must then actually be consumed. Gratitude and the idea of enjoying the cake is all that is needed. The woman in question could simply have been too busy enjoying the company to get the chance to eat her serving of cake. But declaring outright that she wants something else is hurtful to the people who attempted to please everyone — however unsuccessful the effort may have been. Dear Miss Manners: My husband is a priest, and when parishioners send gifts home with him, I write and send the thank-you notes. This has really helped to establish a bond with the church members since I am often home with little ones. One Saturday night, my husband brought home a beautiful handmade baby blanket. I wrote the thank-you note Sunday, but we learned Monday that the woman had died quite unexpectedly over the weekend. I could have sent the card, and the family would probably have assumed that it had been sent before I heard. I opted instead to write a note to the daughter saying how sorry I was to hear of her mother's passing, how beautiful the blanket was and that her mother's kindness had outlived her. Was that the correct choice? What should I have done if the note had already gone? What is the correct response when the giver dies before thanks are sent? To prioritize condolences, but include an acknowledgment of their generosity, as you so graciously did. Further, Miss Manners would like to point out that yours is an excellent case for writing prompt thank-you letters.

IATSE, the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, a union representing workers such as camera operators, makeup artists and editors, said it had reached an agreement Saturday with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), a group representing major producers including Walt Disney Studios, Paramount Pictures, Netflix and Amazon. The new agreement, which will need to be ratified by union members, includes mandatory 10-hour break periods between shifts and a 54-hour weekend. Workers had raised issues with work bleeding into evenings and weekends. The agreement covers about 40,000 union members on the West Coast; members in local unions in other parts of the country will need to pursue a separate agreement. A large majority of IATSE members — 98.6 percent of the 90 percent who voted — moved two weeks ago to authorize the strike of 60,000 workers, which was set to start Monday at 12:01 a.m. if an agreement was not reached. A strike in 2007 among television and film writers lasted for 14 weeks, tanking ratings. IATSE President Matthew Loeb hailed the agreement as a “Hollywood ending” for its members. In an email sent to members on Saturday, the union celebrated 3 percent annual wage increases, mandated rest periods, diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, and a “living wage achieved.” But reaction among workers was mixed, casting uncertainty over whether the agreement would be ratified, with some criticizing what they said was a lack of progress from previous contracts. An Instagram account for IATSE members to gather and share struggles of their long hours and other problems in the industry was flooded on Saturday night with comments that the agreement did not go far enough, particularly in protecting workers from long workdays. Allyson Greven, 27, is a set costumer and union member in Los Angeles who said she would vote no on ratifying the agreement. The break periods set by the agreement are already in place for her costumers’ union, she said, adding that she was disappointed that the agreement did not appear to fix the problem of low pay and long hours. Greven said she often works 12 hours or more, with long commutes — sometimes as long as two hours. Some days, workers are told that there won’t be a lunch break, she said, adding that she was not optimistic that penalties for production companies that don’t offer meal breaks would mitigate that issue. “You never have time to eat,” she said. “You barely have time to go to the bathroom during the day when you’re shooting. It’s ridiculous.” Mike Miller, IATSE’s vice president, said with the agreement, “workers should have improved morale and be more alert,” adding that “health and safety standards have been upgraded.” IATSE said in a statement before the strike vote that the group of producers had not spoken with the union’s bargaining team for two weeks. The pending strike hastened the talks, it said. And on Friday night, “they caved,” a senior IATSE official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details of the negotiations, told The Washington Post. The agreement also includes a minimum $20 hourly wage, a 25 percent increase for the lowest earners, the official said. It also contains “improved wages and working conditions for streaming,” IATSE said. Workers had raised concerns that streaming services paid lower wages and had longer hours than traditional production companies, and that they contributed less to pensions and health-care plans. Many workers in Hollywood television and film productions are not salaried employees of one production studio but function like gig workers, going from project to project with different companies. Greven said that she hadn’t worked for a streaming service’s show in a “very, very, very long time\" because she wanted to avoid the lower rates. Apple, for example, had asked to pay workers a discounted rate because it has fewer subscribers than other streaming services. But, workers noted, its show “Ted Lasso” won several awards at the Emmys last month. IATSE members will receive the details of the agreement in the coming week before a ratification vote is held online. The union, in its message to members, said it was “currently working out the details” of the process to ratify the agreement.

The editor, American Airlines captain Linda Pauwels, knew of my work as a journalist writing about aviation. I hadn’t read much beyond the first pages before I realized Pauwels’s book included one jaw-dropping contributor: Among the poems written across a century of flight are several previously unpublished pieces by the most famous aviatrix of them all, Amelia Earhart. Dozens, if not hundreds of books have been written about Earhart, arguably the patron saint of women fliers. But I was not alone in my ignorance of Earhart’s secret desire to have her poems published. Despite her many accomplishments, she disappeared in 1937 not having achieved that goal. That changes with the publication of Pauwels’s book, “Beyond Haiku: Women Pilots Write Poetry.” Earhart’s husband, George Palmer Putnam, wrote in his biography of her, “Truly, I think among all her crowding ambitions, AE would have enjoyed best of all the leisure to play about with the friends she liked so well — words.” The story of how these poems and others became public nearly 85 years after Earhart’s disappearance is a fascinating one. And according to Sammie Morris, archivist of the Earhart collection at Purdue University, they will cast the aviatrix in a new light. A ‘bogus photo,’ decades of obsession and the endless debate over Amelia Earhart Earhart was one of the earliest aviators, a record-setter, a college professor and well ahead of her time as a champion for women’s rights. Yet she is also one of history’s more enigmatic figures, not just because of the way she died, on the final leg of a round-the-world flight, but also because, throughout her public life, she was tenacious about guarding her privacy, including her desire to be a writer. Putnam described it as “almost secret.” “When I read Amelia Earhart’s poems, I knew right away she was one of us,” Pauwels said, noting that her poems addressed the same themes as other aviators: strength, endurance and a love of flight. “Our voices are speaking of similar things.” In the poem “From an Airplane,” Earhart writes: “Even the watchful, purple hills That hold the lake Could not see so well as I The stain of evening Creeping from its heart Nor the round, yellow eyes of the hamlet Growing filmy with mists” While two professional journals have featured some of the poems since their discovery, five of those in “Beyond Haiku” have never been published, elevating a niche poetry volume with a feminist bent to the latest twist in the mysterious Earhart saga. Sign up for the Book World newsletter Only one poem penned by Earhart was made public during her lifetime and it was contrary to her wishes, according to Morris, who is also a professor of library science at Purdue. In an article she wrote for Provenance, Journal of the Society of Georgia Archivists in 2005, Morris explained that Earhart turned down a 1928 request by author Marion Perkins to use the poem “Courage” in an article she was writing about Earhart, but it appeared nonetheless. No other poems emerged even in the decades after Earhart and her navigator, Fred Noonan, vanished on July 2, 1937. Few people beyond Putnam even knew of their existence. Putnam’s secret may have been easier to keep because in 1934 a fire at the home he and Earhart shared in Rye, N.Y., destroyed many of her personal papers. What few realized was that hundreds of her documents survived the blaze, including dozens of poems in various stages of completion. Putnam never revealed that — even to Earhart’s family. Fifty years after Putnam died in 1950, those documents, which his widow gave to Putnam’s granddaughter, were donated to Purdue — paving the way for their publication. To Morris the poems are an “amazing puzzle piece,” even while they create more puzzles. Considering Earhart’s reticence, why did she risk exposing her intimate thoughts by writing them? That Earhart’s mother delivered a stillborn baby in 1896, the year before Earhart was born, has been reported, but among Earhart’s papers is a handwritten, untitled poem that reveals the enduring impact of that event on the aviatrix: “The firstborn child of my mother Died in a few hours Does she hold it still As she might have him When we fail?” “She was such a complex person, who had a defined sense of what was and was not public, and poems may be the way she tried to thread that needle,” said Traci Brimhall, a poet and professor at Kansas State University. Brimhall wrestled with Earhart’s poetry for an article she wrote for Literary Hub. The author most recently of “Come the Slumberless to the Land of Nod,” Brimhall developed a fascination with Earhart, with whom she shares a birthday, during a visit to Earhart’s childhood home in Atchison, Kan. At the archives at Purdue, Brimhall lingered over the poems. They were written in pencil and riddled with edits and notes. Part literary detective and part fellow traveler, Brimhall extrapolated from her own experience as she tried to decipher Earhart’s words. “Poetry is like a secret clouded in metaphor, but by transforming emotions into images, you make thoughts and feelings into an art form,” Brimhall said. “The risk is that others can see the things you’ve hidden from yourself, and a poem can accidentally confess something private.” Still, as Brimhall writes in her analysis of the poems, she was unable to turn the poetry fragments into a revelatory narrative, leaving Earhart’s desire for opacity intact, at least for now. In “Beyond Haiku,” Earhart’s poems appear alongside the works of other pilots over the past century, including Louise Thaden. Her untitled poem was written following her first solo flight. Earhart and Thaden were close friends and occasional competitors. Few knew Earhart as well as Thaden, said Keith O’Brien, author of “Fly Girls: How Five Daring Women Defied the Odds and Made Aviation History.” “Both women were not just great and daring pilots at a time where most men believed women should stand firmly planted on the ground,” O’Brien said. “Both women were great writers who knew how to turn a phrase and make people think by the words they chose.” She awed the country before Amelia Earhart even took to the skies Earhart used words to challenge traditional thinking about women’s roles and turned the spotlight on literature that left women out of the story. “No one can scan the shelves of teenage reading matter without being struck with the fact that girls are evidently not expected to join in the fun,” she wrote in a speech to a group of librarians. “There are no heroines following the shining paths of romantic adventure as do the heroes of boys’ books.” She put her words into action in the fall of 1935 when she accepted a job as adviser to Purdue’s aeronautics program and its first career counselor for female students. At the time she said, “I hope this movement will spread through all branches of applied science and industry and that women can come to share with men, the joy of doing.” So it seems fitting that Earhart’s poems should debut in a book dedicated to honoring female pilots and encouraging girls to become pilots. Morris, the Purdue professor, was the first person to write about Earhart’s newly discovered poems in her 2005 article. Now she hopes the publicity surrounding the latest Earhart poems to be published in “Beyond Haiku” will trigger other discoveries. “It is possible in some family attic there are some other things that she wrote,” Morris said. “If there are other unpublished things out there, it would be a tremendous find.” \n Christine Negroni is an aviation writer and the author of the New York Times bestseller, “The Crash Detectives.” Find her at christinenegroni.com.

"Philip Kennicott", "date": "October 15, 2021 at 7:00 a.m. EDT", "body": "PHILADELPHIA — In the space of three small galleries in the Barnes Collection exhibition “Suzanne Valadon: Model, Painter, Rebel,” you encounter one of the most exciting transformations in art history. Valadon, born as Marie-Clémentine Valadon in 1865, is seen first as the subject of paintings by other artists, including as a voluptuous siren, floating in a stormy sea, with blond hair flowing in the water and arms outstretched to ensnare a hapless mariner. Next, we see her early work, domestic sketches of her son and mother, evocative but sometimes a little clumsy. And then we turn the corner, and there she is, fully fledged, a brilliant artist, making breathtaking paintings that have the flat, colorful solidity of Gauguin, but a piercing intelligence and emotional insight. She was self-taught, and in the span of just a little more than a decade, went from competence to mastery, and not just mastery. She uncovered and made legible new kinds of domesticity beyond the expectations of bourgeois propriety. She was to interior space what painters of the sublime were to the natural world, an explorer and an adventurer, charting new realms of ambition, desire and ennui. Valadon came to the bohemian world of French art through the servant’s entrance, working first as an artist’s model. Respectable women didn’t do this. The work required professionalism and stamina, the ability to hold a pose, to erase one’s particularity, to suppress or exaggerate emotions, and to defend one’s ego and body against male painters who would exploit both. These skills were too often rewarded with sexual harassment and abuse. Women were idealized in paint but dehumanized in person. Valadon was only 15 when she began to model, posing for artists including Gustav Wertheimer, who painted the image of her as a siren when she was about 17. She also appears in works by Toulouse-Lautrec, Pierre Puvis de Chavannes and Renoir, who used her in two of his better paintings, “Dance at Bougival” and “Dance in the City.” When she was 18, she bore a child (the father remains unknown), who grew up to be the painter Maurice Utrillo, a troubled figure who was not nearly as inventive as his mother. And she had affairs with the composer Erik Satie and Toulouse-Lautrec, who gave her the nickname Suzanne, based on the biblical Susanna, ogled and abused by the Elders in a story from the Book of Daniel. The brilliant and often bleak legacy of Jasper Johns Standard accounts of Valadon’s life suggest she used her time modeling to absorb artistic wisdom from the male painters who objectified her. Maybe, though it’s hard to imagine how much practical information she could glean while sitting on the opposite side of the easel. Her early drawings suggest, rather, an extraordinary amount of raw talent, followed by prodigiously rapid development. She stopped modeling in 1906 and by 1912 was painting at a very high level. Between her first artistic forays and a large 1912 group portrait of her with her family — including her son Maurice, her son’s friend André Utter and her mother — she married, divorced and built a self-sufficient career as an independent artist. The painting, titled “Family Portrait,” is a stunner. Utter, her lover who was then in his mid-20s, is seen mostly in profile. Her son, who suffered from alcoholism,  droops dejectedly in the foreground, and her mother looks in from behind, age scarring  her face like water scours canyons. Valadon is the center of the grouping, her hand on her heart, her eyes directly addressing the viewer. The gesture with her right hand has the self-deprecating confidence of a someone who is almost terrified of her own abilities. She is the head of the family, the author of the image, a beautiful woman with a lover (and later husband) almost half her age. She has forged a family unlike almost any other family one might see in a painting from the 19th or 20th centuries. Mary Cassatt or Berthe Morisot would never have painted anything like this. They not only came from an earlier generation, but they also came from money and privilege. Nor were they likely to paint their younger lover entirely naked, as Valadon did in her 1909 “Adam and Eve,” a double portrait in which Utter tenderly directs Valadon’s hand up to the fatal apple. As artist Lisa Brice speculates in a catalogue essay, “Valadon benefited from a level of freedom that Cassatt’s and Morisot’s upper-class standing made practically impossible for them to experience.” This exhibition, billed as the first devoted to Valadon at a major U.S. museum, includes more than 50 works, and almost all of them are arresting. As suggested by the show’s subtitle (“Model, Painter, Rebel”) there is an effort to connect Valadon’s early years as subject to her greater career as maker. Is this seen in the particularly direct way that models look out of the canvas? In greater empathy for the naked female figure? In the way that, as Brice suggests, her portraits of other people are “always, to a degree, a self-portrait”? Barbara Kruger was always right, about everything Probably all of the above. But it’s also true that bodies, in her imagery, are thoroughly de-romanticized. Wertheimer, an Austrian painter who once had a significant international reputation, may have painted the young Valadon as a supple siren. But when Valadon paints bodies, they always seem to be stubbornly present. Not ugly, nor intentionally stolid, nor contorted into awkward shapes, as her friend Degas often painted them. But with their heavy outlines, and the riot of color and pattern that surround them, they inhabit the image with a forceful, blunt, plain-spoken insistence. The last thing the woman in the 1923 work “The Blue Room,” often cited as Valadon’s masterpiece, is going to do is change her posture or her expression or her clothes. The world gathers around her and surges up to her formidable presence, and she remains, for as long as we look, immutable. Throughout the show, you see how well Valadon knew the work of other artists. Gauguin and van Gogh and Cézanne are all somewhere in the background. But the pure weirdness of Valadon’s vision, the way a foot seems to summon a carpet to life, or a still life bubbles over into quasi-abstraction, erases any sense of indebtedness to others. Like the bodies she paints, her peculiarities are stubbornly present, convincing, insistent and irreducible. \n Suzanne Valadon: Model, Painter, Rebel is on view at the Barnes Collection in Philadelphia through Jan. 9.

Haynes’s approach is certainly nontraditional: In addition to contemporary interviews with former band members John Cale and Maureen Tucker, the filmmaker tries to emulate the psychedelic look and feel of the band’s early shows (staged by artist/producer Andy Warhol, under the umbrella of the multimedia moniker Exploding Plastic Inevitable, with film projection, flashing lights, dancers and other performers from Warhol’s Factory). The resulting collage-y, split-screen, stroboscopic gimmick wears a bit thin at times, and makes it sometimes hard to follow the exact chronology of the story, without a conventional narrator or on-screen dates and place names. But it’s a lively and well-told history for the most part, particularly when we get to listen to Jonathan Richman — an acolyte of the band while still in high school, who went on to form the Modern Lovers, and release an album produced by Cale. Richman is a charmingly goofy raconteur, and — alone among the film’s talking heads — speaks to the Velvet Underground as music-makers, and not just as a cultural phenomenon. Now if only Haynes would make his next music documentary entirely about him. R. Available on Apple TV Plus. Contains crude language, nudity and sexual and drug references. 121 minutes.  — Michael O'Sullivan First-time director and co-writer Carson Young (“Scream: The TV Series”) stars in “The Blazing World,” about a self-destructive young woman (Carlson Young) who finds an alternate dimension in which her dead twin sister might still be alive. According to IndieWire, the first-time film on an indie budget — which also stars Udo Kier, Dermot Mulroney and Vinessa Shaw — offers “something truly impressive.” Unrated. Available on demand. 99 minutes. The documentary “Convergence: Courage in a Crisis” tells nine separate stories about everyday people who have responded in courageous ways to the covid pandemic. According to the New York Times, “The critical edge of the film feels blunted by platitudes (‘Opportunities are born from crises,’ says Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization), not to mention the exhaustion viewers will likely feel in reliving early memories of the still-ongoing pandemic for nearly two hours.” R. Available on Netflix. Contains some coarse language. 113 minutes. In “Killing Eleanor,” Natalie (Annika Marks) is a recovering addict who has moved in with her mother (Jane Kaczmarek) on the condition she stays off drugs. This precipitates a situation in which Natalie agrees to facilitate the assisted suicide of an elderly runaway named Eleanor (Jenny O’Hara) — a terminally ill nursing home resident — in exchange for Eleanor’s clean urine. According to Film Threat, “You may be familiar with terminal illness/road trip/buddy movies, but it’s probably been a while since you’ve seen one actually pull it off in such an elegant way.” Unrated. Available on demand. 106 minutes.  “Needle in a Timestack” is a sci-fi romance set in a near future in which time travel is commonplace. Leslie Odom Jr. and Cynthia Erivo play Nick and Janine, a husband and wife whose marriage is threatened by the attempted machinations of Janine’s time-traveling ex-husband (Orlando Bloom), who hopes to break up the marriage by tampering with the fabric of time and space. Slant magazine says that, “Ultimately, the film is too blinded by manufactured sentimentality to see the more compelling what-if scenario lying right in front of its eyes.” R.

Let’s talk about the best literary blood suckers since. - The Washington Post", "author": "None", "date": "8:00 a.m. EDT", "body": "What is the appeal of the vampire novel — and how did this burgeoning horror subgenre begin? Silvia might point to John Polidori’s 1819 novel “The Vampyre,” inspired by the same ghost storytelling night on Lake Geneva that gave us Mary Shelley’s “Frankenstein.” Lavie might counter with Sheridan Le Fanu’s “Carmilla,” the progenitor of lesbian vampires. But there’s no denying it was Bram Stoker who, with 1897’s “Dracula,” dragged the vampire into the limelight. From “Salem’s Lot” to “Twilight,” “The Historian,” “Let the Right One In,” Anne Rice’s Lestat and Charlaine Harris’s Bill Compton, vampires are everywhere. So come with us as we bid you welcome, Renfields! Let’s talk about the wonderful bloodsuckers of literature. Lavie: I feel you have an unfair advantage, in that you actually wrote a vampire novel and I didn’t! I know whatever we do people will say, “How could you not mention . . . ?” So, yes, Richard Matheson’s “I Am Legend” (1954) is a vampire novel — a very good one. But we like to focus on books that have gotten less notice. So, from Russia, there’s Sergei Lukyanenko’s “Night Watch” (and its sequels), translated by Andrew Bromfield. The book isn’t about vampires exclusively, but the ones that are there are great. In modern-day Moscow, supernatural creatures battle each other, some taking the side of the dark and some of the light. Huge bestsellers in Russia, I came to them through the two Timur Bekmambetov film adaptations. More book reviews and recommendations Meanwhile, I think it was you who turned me on to Kazuki Sakuraba’s “A Small Charred Face” (2017), translated by Jocelyne Allen, a terrific Japanese vampire novel told in three parts. It’s very different from typical Western fare — not only because of the biology of the vampires, but the tone of the book — and all the better for it. So is José Luis Zárate’s “The Route of Ice and Salt,” translated by David Bowles, the Mexican novella you managed to bring into English recently through your micro-press, Innsmouth Free Press. I thought it was wonderful, a queer exploration of Dracula’s journey on board ship to England that is full of haunting Gothic imagery. Silvia: So many of our conversations involve me asking: “Have you read this vampire book?” But if you are not a vampire junkie, where do you start? I recommend anthologies as a gateway. Ellen Datlow edited several of these, including, “Blood and Other Cravings” (2011) and “Blood is Not Enough” (1989). Datlow also famously ran Omni magazine, where a vampire novella titled “Carrion Comfort” by Dan Simmons first appeared. It was expanded in 1989 into an award-winning novel with the same title. In a nutshell, it’s about wealthy, psychic vampires who control the world and hunt humans for sport. More recently, there’s “Slay: Stories of the Vampire Noire” (2020), edited by Nicole Givens Kurtz. Although traditionally vampires have tended to be pasty and European, this volume centers on Black characters. “The Gilda Stories” (1991) by Jewelle L. Gómez is another book that focuses on Black protagonists, following a former enslaved person turned vampire through the centuries. Let’s talk about the best sword and sorcery books One of the weirdest vampires I’ve encountered appears in “The Wisdom of Crocodiles” (2000) by Paul Hoffman. This is an odd novel that follows a wide cast of characters. The most compelling story line, for me, was that of Steven Grlscz, an emotional vampire whose relationships culminate in murder. As I said, this is an odd novel that is not really about vampires, it’s more of a literary exercise that just happens to have a vampire dangling there. But boy is it worth reading for him. Last but not least, I must mention Billy Martin, who writes as Poppy Z. Brite. He still utilizes the pen name but has moved on to nonfiction. Now you can find him on Patreon where he posts bits of “Water If God Wills It: Religion and Spirituality in the Work of Stephen King,” his latest project. Back in the ’90s, Martin was focused on novels. “Lost Souls,” his debut, is a blood-soaked gem about vampires that seem to follow the mantra of “Sleep all day. Party all night” in all its violent, decadent glory. It would be lovely to see this, along with the collection “Wormwood” (1993), which contains the excellent vampire short story “His Mouth Will Taste of Wormwood” in new editions. Lavie: I would be remiss not to mention one of my favorite vampires of recent years, Christopher Farnsworth’s Nathaniel Cade in “Blood Oath” (2010) and its sequels. It takes politics into horror — and horror into politics — in such an awe-inspiring over the top way that I wanted to applaud. Cade is a vampire in service to the president of the United States, and in the first book, he must stop an al-Qaeda zombie invasion while worrying about the Deep State and its Lovecraftian end-of-the-world plans. I think American political reality eventually got too weird even for Farnsworth, though Cade’s been popping up in shorter works, including “Deep State” (2017). All in all, I’d say there’s still plenty of life in the undead — and what sweet music they make! \n Silvia Moreno-Garcia’s books include “Mexican Gothic,” “Velvet Was the Night” and “The Return of the Sorceress.” Lavie Tidhar is the author of the novels“The Violent Century,” “A Man Lies Dreaming,” “By Force Alone” and the “Gorel of Goliris” stories.

The narrator is a father who watches from a distance as his son grows up and becomes an adult. Over a handful of pages, the reader is presented with a case study of how much and how little can change for a Black man over a generation. The characters may come across a bit flat, but the lens through which they are seen — systemic racism, educational inequity and policing — is well focused. The narrative builds to a terrible, violent event, but even amid that suffering, there is a glimmer of hope for both father and son. “Buying a House Ahead of the Apocalypse” is a standout, in part because of how it is told. The tale is presented as a checklist, something many of us use to simply help manage our daily lives. But for this narrator, an unnamed Black woman, simple tasks become infinitely more difficult because of her race. For instance, as a would-be home buyer about to meet a loan officer, she must remind herself to wear her hair in a style that does not draw too much attention to her race — “bone straight, a fresh weave with the tight itch of cornrows beneath, like something true but hidden.” She even struggles with “the dark-skinned guard” who won’t let her into an open house. The story is a portrait, in list form, of the universally human search for something normal, someplace safe, even in the face of futility: “Vote, but don’t expect it to save you. March, but don’t expect it to save you. Pray, but don’t expect it to save you.” ‘The Love Songs of W.E.B. Du Bois’ is the kind of brilliant epic that comes around only once in a decade Of the five pieces in the collection, though, it is the title novella that best demonstrates Johnson’s creative skill. “My Monticello” is a historical deep dive that takes place in a terrifying near future. The setting is Virginia, where Johnson was born. In her dedication, Johnson, a longtime public school art teacher, thanks her parents for making the state a home. However, for her characters, Virginia has become most inhospitable. In this tale, the narrator is a young University of Virginia student. She and a small band of neighbors have been forced to flee their homes. The traumatized refugees are mostly Black and Latino people, chased out by a white militia whose rallying cry is “OURS!”. While this calls to mind the deadly 2017 “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, readers are taken even further back through the country’s fraught racial history, as the group arrives at Thomas Jefferson’s Virginia plantation, Monticello. The narrator, Da’Naisha Love, is familiar with the place, having once interned there. What’s more, she is a descendant of Jefferson and Sally Hemings and recalls what it was like when her family members were officially informed of their lineage: “I should say that our family did not need a call from Monticello to tell us we were Thomas Jefferson’s descendants. The story of our connection to that man and this place was already woven into the Love family lore . . . like a cautionary tale.” More book reviews and recommendations And it is with caution that Love and her traumatized band of fellow survivalists — which includes her grandmother and her White boyfriend — approach the third president’s Virginia estate, a place overflowing with reminders of the enslaved people who built it. For Love and her fellow travelers, there is an excavating, a reclaiming of things left to history: Jefferson’s great clock, high beds, the very stairway trod by enslaved people. In one instance, the narrator points to the enduring echoes of privilege and the lack thereof: “these rooms had been kept so pristine, while our homes in town had been treated as kindling.” What makes “My Monticello” particularly resonant is that it does not stray far from life as we know it today. In the near future conjured by Johnson, there are the heat waves and wildfires that bring climate change into view. There is fallout from a fraught election. There is the vile replacement theory rhetoric of the right wing. But the lives of Johnson’s richly drawn characters — their personal stories — are always in focus. And, because of it, the storytelling is propulsive, as we follow these refugees along a harrowing journey, with danger ever at their heels. “My Monticello” is, quite simply, an extraordinary debut from a gifted writer with an unflinching view of history and what may come of it. \n Anissa Gray is a journalist and the author of the novel “The Care and Feeding of Ravenously Hungry Girls.” By Jocelyn Nicole Johnson Henry Holt. 224 pp. $26.99 We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program,\n    an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking\n    to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.

My household has been in dire need of comfort lately, and my husband and I have been gravitating toward stereotypical American comfort food, meaning carbs and sweets and — jackpot! — carby sweets. This is by no means a rant against carbs; I couldn’t live without them. But the problem with some “comfort” food is that I don’t always feel so comfortable after eating it — at least not when I go overboard, which of course I’m more likely to do when I’m emotionally needy. It’s a vicious circle. So lately I’ve been looking to bring some balance back to my eating, and I turned to “Power Plates,” a 2018 cookbook by Gena Hamshaw with a plant-based protein, fat and carbs in every recipe. Since I’ve been slowly getting my cooking mojo back after losing it in the wake of our foster son’s departure, it also has helped that Hamshaw’s recipes are quick and simple. This restorative soup of collards, potatoes and chiles soothes a foster dad grieving a child’s departure The one I keep coming back to is this white chili, which combines beans with butternut squash, quinoa and two types of canned chiles — mild green ones and spicier chipotles. I love how the chiles contrast, how easily the dish comes together. The most time-consuming part of the prep is dealing with the butternut squash, but a sharp knife, a peeler and a little video tutorial from my colleague Aaron Hutcherson are all you need. Once the chili’s on the table, I think you’ll agree: Comfort never tasted so good, nor felt so nourishing. Want to save this recipe?

Scale and get a printer-friendly, desktop version of the recipe here. Storage Notes: The chili can be refrigerated for up to 1 week or frozen for up to 6 months. In a large pot over medium heat, heat the oil until shimmering. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until it's tender and translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until very fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in the beans, zucchini, squash, green chiles, chipotles in adobo, smoked paprika, cumin, chili powder and salt, followed by the broth and quinoa. Increase the heat to high, bring to a boil, then lower the heat until the mixture is simmering, cover, and cook until the squash is fork-tender and the quinoa is fully cooked, about 20 minutes. Uncover and cook, stirring occasionally, until the chili is thickened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the lime juice, taste, and season with more salt and/or lime juice, if needed. Serve hot.

The vitriol! The name-calling! I understand how tempers get heated and rhetoric gets out of hand over things like politics and religion, but how did we get to a place where people are vile to other people because they disagree about carbohydrate metabolism? A lot of people in this space are trying, in good faith, to be helpful, so I would hope we could ratchet down the nastiness. In an effort to spread a little kumbaya, I thought I would try to sketch out areas of agreement, and there are more than you might think. Here, in the interest of peace on Earth, or at least on Twitter, are five (maybe even six) diet-related ideas that everyone agrees on. But, before I tell you what they are, I have to tell you who, exactly, “everyone” is. It is not literally everyone. There is literally nothing that literally everyone agrees on, up to and including the roundness of Earth. Whatever I put forward as a universal, there will be a rock under which you will find dissenters. Nevertheless, there are many universals that the colloquial “everyone” really does agree on. Everyone within shouting distance of reasonable, everyone who actually knows something about diet and nutrition, everyone who does not live under a rock. This isn’t even about diet. It’s about physics. Calories are a unit of energy, and all the energy your body absorbs from food (which isn’t all the energy in food, see No. 3) must either be expended or stored as fat. If you’ve stored more than  you would like, and you want to lose some of it, you have to find a way to absorb fewer calories, burn more or both. One argument goes like this: Health authorities have been talking about calorie deficits for decades, yet obesity continues to skyrocket. Ergo, calories-in-calories-out (CICO) is nonsense. Venison is the most eco-friendly food on the planet — if you hunt the deer yourself What if it was money instead of calories? You can tell people till you’re blue in the face that, if they want to save money, they have to earn more than they spend. It’s just math. Yet 36 percent of American households report that  they would have trouble paying for a $400 emergency. Does that mean earning more than you spend isn’t the key to accumulating savings? Or does it just mean that earning more than you spend is hard, especially if you’re, say, a single parent with a low-wage job and an ailing father and no health insurance — and you just got a rent increase. Nobody believes that the math is particularly helpful in either situation, but saying “CICO is debunked!” has led some people to believe that No. 1, above, isn’t true. Magical thinking isn’t helping here. It takes calories to process the food you eat, and each of the macronutrients — fat, carbs, protein — requires a different amount. (Scientists call this the “thermic effect of food” because “digestive overhead” was way too descriptive.) Protein is the hardest for our bodies to break down, and you use 20 to 30 percent of its calories to do the job. Carbohydrates are easier, and require 5 to 10 percent of their calories. Fat is easiest, and requires about 3 percent. Why ‘moderation’ is the worst weight-loss advice ever And, of course, not everything you eat is absorbed. Plant foods have fiber and other kinds of compounds that you can’t break down completely, and some of those calories pass right through you. There’s also some evidence that a very-low-carbohydrate diet may increase energy expenditure (and some that it doesn’t), and the question of whether it’s enough to be meaningful is disputed. And that’s the key here: The amount of the difference. Yes, you can rejigger your diet to change the calorie equation, but the question is whether you can change it enough so that the difference is effective for weight loss. I am skeptical, simply because so many people have tried so much rejiggering, and we haven’t yet lit on an effective combination. But one of the great things about weight-loss diets is that they don’t have to work for everyone. They only have to work for you. While many low-carb advocates believe carbohydrates are uniquely fattening, you don’t have to believe that to think passing on pasta is a good idea. Refined grains — white bread, white rice, pasta — have had most of their nutrition stripped out of them, so all you’re giving up is calories. (Most white flour has had some nutrients put back in, and one of them is folic acid. The only caveat here is that if you’re pregnant or thinking of becoming pregnant, you may want to supplement with folic acid if you’re cutting out fortified white flour.) All processed food isn’t bad. We took a nutritionist shopping to find reasonable options. For many of us, refined carbs are also diabolically easy to overeat. I hear the siren song of baguettes loud and clear, and once I rip the crusty end off the fresh loaf, it’s all over. Carbohydrates are also a key element in the delicious carbs/fats combination. There’s some evidence that foods that have both are more appealing to us than foods that are one or the other. If you make a list of foods you tend to overeat, chances are good that a lot of them combine fats and carbohydrates in extremely delicious ways. Cut back on carbs, and you cut back on those. When my weight creeps up, which it periodically does, refined carbohydrates are the first thing to go. (Besides, if it wasn’t that, it might have to be the wine.) I have fought my weight all my life, and I’m winning now, but I didn’t always. I’ve personally experienced the difference between Existing While Fat and being relatively thin; it is remarkable and it is dismaying. Anyone who has ever been overweight knows how unpleasant a place the world can be, but the unpleasantness has been codified in studies of employment, health care, schools and just plain living. I think we all want that to stop, although not everyone agrees about how. For some, it means not talking about weight loss at all — and I hear from those people every time I write about it — but I can’t agree. Weight is about the most personal decision going, and yours is nobody else’s business. There are people who are comfortable and happy at a weight classified as obese, and I think that’s totally fine, because being comfortable and happy is more important than losing weight. But there are many others who want to be thinner, and they need support, too. Here’s what the government’s dietary guidelines should really say I’d like to believe in a sixth idea we can all agree on: that nastiness doesn’t make this better. Whether you’re keto or vegan, low-carb or low-fat (and, yes, there are still some of those and it’s okay), congratulations if you’ve found a diet that you enjoy and that helps keep you at the weight you want to be. By all means, share your story, or your theory, or your recipes. But keep in mind that, in studies, no diet works appreciably better than any other in the long term. Although low-carb diets are a bit more successful than others in the short term, by the time you get to two years, what few long-term trials there are show very little weight loss and no more than a few pounds’ worth of difference between diets. The best evidence for the failure of diets, though, is the trajectory of our collective weight gain, which makes it clear that eating a healthful diet and being the weight you want to be is hard. But having a constructive, respectful conversation about it shouldn’t be. Can’t we dial back the sneering and the smugness, the venom and contempt? The idea that we should be nice to one another shouldn’t be controversial.

The Washington Post", "author": "Dave McIntyre", "date": "October 15, 2021 at 12:00 p.m. EDT", "body": "Last week, I wrote about Robin Lail experiencing Napa Valley’s modern wine history through boom and bust, and how she was addressing the current challenge of climate change as an ambassador for the Porto Protocol, an international effort to rally the global wine industry to grapple with the existential crisis of today. I mentioned she was practicing carbon farming in her vineyards, but I didn’t explain in detail what carbon farming entails. Several commenters suggested — some even politely — that a fuller explanation of this enticing-sounding concept would be in order. Others raised additional methods for wineries to reduce their environmental impacts, most of which I’ve written about before. So this week, I’d like to summarize some of the ways wineries are tackling the climate crisis. This will be a high-level discussion, perhaps meriting more detailed coverage in future columns. Some wine regions are reconsidering the grape varieties that define them, while others are taking a more literal down-to-earth approach. So what is carbon farming? (No, you’re not growing carbon.) The idea is to capture more carbon from the atmosphere than you release into it. It’s also called carbon sequestration (which sounds like an unfortunate jury in a celebrity murder trial) or regenerative farming, though adherents of each term might argue some nuances. It means composting biomass and growing cover crops between vine rows. You don’t want to till those cover crops, because tilling the soil releases carbon into the atmosphere, so “no till” or “minimal till” are key concepts. You also want to minimize use of tractors or other machinery that can compact the soil. That means employing animals, including sheep to graze on the cover crops during the winter, when the vines will not entice them with fresh food. The resulting manure helps fertilize the vineyard without synthetic chemicals. Tablas Creek winery in California’s Paso Robles region employs a full-time shepherd to tend its flock. Sheep among the dormant vine rows are also quite photogenic and ideal for marketing. Carbon farming may sound trendy, but it’s really old-school agriculture backed up by modern data on carbon capture and reducing our carbon footprint. Skeptics argue that it doesn’t capture enough carbon to make a difference against climate change, which is why carbon farming goes hand-in-hand with efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Winemaking is power-intensive. You need temperature control to manage fermentation and ensure proper storage so your wine doesn’t spoil. Solar power arrays are now a familiar sight at wineries — they thrive on abundant sunshine, after all. Jackson Family Wines, which has been an industry leader in sustainability and climate change, boasts more than 23,000 solar panels at 12 of its wineries in California and Oregon, accounting for 30 percent of its electricity needs. Electric vehicles are also in play. Some California wineries are employing electric tractors in their vineyards and electric forklifts in their wineries. We will undoubtedly see more electric farm equipment in years to come. Wineries can also ease their environmental footprint through water management, especially crucial in California, where an extended years-long drought is predicted. Carbon farming can theoretically help by increasing the soil’s capacity to hold water and feed the vines, reducing the need for irrigation. Go ‘green’ with your wine: Choose cans or boxes, drink local and consider farming practices Bottles might start weighing less. About half of the wine industry’s carbon footprint stems from bottles, from manufacturing to transport (empty) and transport again (when full). Bottles range from about a pound at the light end to more than two pounds for those pretentious behemoths. Some winemakers like heavy bottles for aesthetic reasons, while others say heavier bottles are necessary for wines meant to age. That point strikes me as nonsense, because most Bordeaux chateaus don’t use ridiculously heavy bottles for their age-worthy wines. (Protection from light could be a benefit of thicker glass, as wine, unlike democracy, thrives in darkness. So keep the lights off in your cellar.) Progress on this front is likely to be slow. But in addition to lighter-weight bottles, you’ll see more wines in clear glass, which is easier to recycle than green or amber. Fewer bottles will be topped with foil, paper or plastic capsules, which are traditional but purely decorative. And even though glass will almost certainly remain the packaging of choice, we may see more boxes and cans, especially for wines not intended for cellaring. Social responsibility has also become part of the climate action agenda. Wineries that achieve Regenerative Organic Certification or become Certified B Corporations — designations not exclusively for the wine industry — pledge to pay their vineyard workers fair wages and benefits and to support local businesses and charities. It’s an acknowledgment that while wine is acutely feeling the early effects of climate change, we’re all in this together.

That led to a frustrated tweet — “80% of the power outlets at airports are lies” — and plenty of commiseration. “This has, like, forever been the case,” they said in an interview. “Power outlets have never worked in airports. They’re just lies.” As long as there have been personal electronic devices in need of electricity, travelers have lamented a lack of places to charge them. The problem, experts say: Airports are generally old, and gadgets are fairly new. The average airport is more than 40 years old, said Scott Elmore, spokesman for Airports Council International – North America. “Most airports were built before 9/11, so they weren’t built for TSA checkpoints,” he said in an email. “And, of course, they were built before there were cellphones.” The New York Times ran a story in 2006 headlined “The Socket Seekers” that described efforts of airports in Atlanta, Chattanooga, Tenn., Anchorage and other cities to add plug-in capability. “Travelers are usually reluctant to complain about the scarcity of outlets,” the story said. “That is because they are unsure if they are allowed to use the sockets, which sometimes appear to be there for the exclusive use of airlines and cleaning crews.” Flying during the pandemic? Don’t forget about the risks at the airport. How times have changed. Social media is crowded with complaints from passengers who can’t find a free outlet, or one that works. They direct ire at fellow travelers who hog power, “some gross dude’s legs” they had to reach through to get to an outlet, and airport architects whom they accuse of orchestrating some sort of millennial blood-sport. Recent years have brought new annoyances, including gag stickers that offer the false promise of electricity. One available online boasts that it is an “easy trick to kill time on a long layover.” Authorities in Los Angeles warned of a ploy involving public USB charging stations in airports and other locations in late 2019 that they referred to as “juice jacking,” in which scammers could steal information by setting up fake power sources. Late 2019 turned into early 2020, and travelers suddenly had a pandemic to worry about instead of power outlets. But as passengers have returned to the skies, they have discovered the old problem — now with the added wrinkle of trying to maintain distance from everyone else. Harriet Baskas, who writes about airports on the blog Stuck at The Airport and elsewhere, said she encountered power problems often in the pre-covid times. “I have had the experience of finally finding an empty chair by a power plug, unpacking all my gear, plugging in my computer and happily tapping away until looking down to realize the power plug isn’t working,” she wrote in an email. 8 unexpected and delightful ways to pass time at airports across the United States She and other travel pros have hacks to avoid the frustration: settling into a lounge if possible, bringing a portable charger or toting a travel surge protector with multiple outlets. “Not one has ever said no when I ask to plug in, since they can plug in too,” longtime aviation journalist Benét J. Wilson, a senior editor at the Points Guy, said in an email. She wrote a guide to airport power outlets that was last updated in 2019. Despite the complaints, airports have been improving — one upgrade at a time — which means travelers’ experiences could depend on which terminal they end up in. Pittsburgh International Airport, which broke ground this week on a massive new terminal, is adding more outlets. Philadelphia International Airport, where finding outlets is “consistently a top priority amenity” for passengers, has added some in past upgrades and “is actively working on plans to increase access to power outlets,” spokeswoman Heather Redfern said in an email. And LAX — the subject of Sosin’s tweet — recently added 300 more places to plug in, spokesman Heath Montgomery said. Baltimore-Washington International Marshall Airport even bragged on Twitter in June about the abundance of outlets in a new area in Concourse A. “We know there’s no such thing as too many charging outlets,” the tweet said. Or as Wilson put it: “Even as airports try to add more, it’s always never enough.” Alexandria, Va., resident Nicole Mathis said in a Twitter message that she chooses to drive the extra miles to Baltimore rather than fly from Reagan National Airport when possible because she knows there will be better amenities, including power, in the terminal. “I applaud airports opening up new terminals with shiny new amenities,” she wrote. “But they mustn’t overlook updating the old terminals.” Mathis said she doesn’t want to have to worry about her phone running out of power before a flight. And while she has seen some people sit on the floor to charge up, that is not ideal either. “What grown adult would choose to sit on an airport floor if they didn’t have to?” she wrote. “Yet, faced between a dirty floor and 20% battery remaining before a 5-hour flight, I can’t think of a soul who wouldn’t cop a squat immediately. ” Elmore said his group’s last survey on airport amenities — conducted in late 2019 and early 2020 — showed 70 airports offering free charging outlets for passengers, up from 59 in 2017. Most outlets are built into seats or tables, which he called “a major infrastructure challenge.” A study released earlier this year, he said, shows airports have infrastructure needs of more than $115 billion. “It’s not as simple as just running a new outlet,” he said in his email. “You have to meet electrical standards and lay incredible configurations of power and circuitry.” What's in the $1.2 trillion infrastructure package Ty Osbaugh,who leads the aviation practice at architecture and design firm Gensler, said airports are looking at a variety of solutions for how much power they have coming into the building and the best ways to distribute it. When he started working on terminals, he said, the plan for power was “you put a few plugs here and a few plugs there in the gate areas and that was probably sufficient. It was mostly maintenance.” For a project his firm is working on for Newark Liberty International Airport, he said, the requirement is that every seat has access to power. “It’s now a mandate,” he said. Osbaugh said that after a pandemic-forced pause in big growth projects, he expects airports to spend the next few years making “fundamental foundational upgrades” to prepare for future growth. But as much as airports do to improve the power situation, Osbaugh said, he expects the needs to evolve. “It’s going to be a never-ending battle to try to get this done right,” he said.

or housekeeping? Test your knowledge. - Washington Post", "author": "Natalie B. Compton", "date": "None", "body": "For a practice thatâs roughly traced to the 17th century, tipping remains a surprisingly confusing practice in modern-day America. The practice â whether on a physical transaction or a digital one â still elicits stress in consumers who arenât certain whom to give extra money to, and how much. Then thereâs the pandemic and its impact on hospitality, which made the process even more complicated. Restaurants added service charges, hotel housekeeping morphed, and there were fewer personal interactions. Maybe youâre comfortable on your home turf, knowing to tip your local barista or neighborhood bartender, but what happens when youâre out of your element? We interviewed etiquette and hospitality experts to clear up some confusion about the custom in America â after all, weâre not born with this information. âWe look for rules, and we look for guidelines, and those are important,â says David Coggins, author of the New York Times best-selling book âMen and Manners.â âBut if you already decide that youâre going to be generous or err on the side of generosity, then youâre always going to make a better decision than if you try to think, âHow little can I get away with?ââ Do you know the rules? Test your tipping knowledge with our quiz below. Yes No Correct! In âMen and Manners,â Coggins writes exactly that: Youâre not fully dressed if you have no cash. As Americans appear to be moving toward a cashless future, tipping becomes more of a calculated effort. âIâm obsessed with not being out of small bills, and I try to think about that ahead of time,â Coggins says. You have to be mindful about having cash on you so you donât stiff those deserving gratuity. If you can, stock up on small bills before your trip. In a pinch, you can compensate for being cashless by asking the person helping you for their digital wallet information such as their Venmo or Cash App handle. âMost people nowadays have Venmo, Paypal or Zelle,â says Ben Pundole, a hotel consultant and founder of A Hotel Life travel website. Such a request may not be normal or expected for all generations, but âitâs not abnormalâ either, he said. Try again! Yes No Correct! When someone touches your bag, you tip. Founder and chief executive of the Protocol School of Palm Beach Jacqueline Whitmore recommends $1 per bag, unless itâs extra heavy (then give $2 per bag). If the driver just drops you off, and you handle your bags, there isnât a need for gratuity. Try again! Yes No Try again! Correct! Keep your singles to yourself on a flight. Most airline staff members are asked to decline tips. âThe best way our customers can recognize our team members is by sending a note to our customer relations team,â said Ross Feinstein, the former director of operations communications at American Airlines. Yes No Correct! Swann School of Protocolâs founder, Elaine Swann, recommends tipping according to how many bags are handled at curbside check-in. âWhen theyâre bringing your bags from your car and theyâre checking them for you: $2 per bag,â she says. Try again! Yes No Try again! Correct! Tipping time is flexible here. It can be at the beginning or end of a stay. There is no hard-and-fast rule on when you should tip hotel staff, so make sure you have small bills to hand out when the situation arises. Yes No Correct! You should absolutely tip your valet attendant, preferably when you hand them your keys. This is a great example of gratuity to ensure proper service â you want the valet on your side. Swann recommends tipping valet drivers $3 and up. âTip them in the beginning and theyâll always look after you,â Pundole says. âThe more you look after them, the more they look after you.â Try again! Yes No Try again! Correct! A hotel manager tends to be a salaried employee who doesnât require a tip. A clue for who to tip and who to skip is to look at how the hotel employee is dressed. âI donât tip someone in a suit from behind the counter,â Coggins says. âGenerally, if a person is wearing a suit or their own clothes, I donât. Theyâre a manager of some higher position and so you donât need to tip them. But if itâs a person in a uniform, you generally do.â Yes No Correct! How much will depend on what kind of hotel youâre at, and what kind of service youâre getting. Did they drop your bags and go quickly? Did they help you unpack, or share helpful details about the room and hotel? Pundole recommends up to $10 for a tip at a luxury hotel. Not everyone wants the help, and thatâs okay, too. âI used to avoid the bellmen and want to do everything myself,â Pundole says. But ultimately, remember that theyâre here to help. âTheyâre proud to be standing at the front of something great and being the first point of contact.â Try again! Yes No Correct! Not everyone knows to tip the cleaning staff, or they choose not to for various reasons. But according to all of our experts, you absolutely tip housekeeping. Itâs a thankless hotel job that often gets overlooked. In his early traveling days, Coggins didnât know to tip housekeeping, an error heâs still embarrassed about today. Itâs now natural for him to tip housekeeping at every hotel. âSome people avoid it because they think theyâre doing it incorrectly, or they donât know if itâs going to be appreciated, or they donât even have the pleasure of handing it to someone,â Coggins says. âThey work really hard. They work long hours,â Pundole adds. âThereâs a level of expectation that they do an exemplary job. They deserve it.â Pundole recommends tipping $10 per day of your visit. However, housekeeping as well as other hospitality elements have changed during the pandemic, and customers may notice a drop-off in services some cases. Pundole recognizes that while service should be rewarded, itâs not a given. People should tip what they can. Try again! Yes No Try again! Correct! All-inclusive properties and cruises can come with rules of their own. âA lot of times the cruise line will give you a guideline on tipping,â Swann says. âThey break it down day by day. Server by server. Follow the guidelines of the cruise line. As far as the rest of the waitstaff is concerned, you would tip the same way on land â if the cruise line allows it.â Yes No Correct! Stephanie Fisher, a certified travel associate for Huffman Travel, says she always adds gratuity, noting that the charges you pay on the app might not directly get to the driver. Weâve heard stories during the pandemic of delivery drivers receiving few tips even as demand and risks have increased. For travel adviser Thomas Chongruk of Escape 2, an independent affiliate of Montecito Village Travel, the answer is yes. While he doesnât think the gesture is mandatory, he feels that it is a courtesy to the person who delivered your meal. Pundole finds some service charges to be exorbitant these days, but he tips a few bucks in-person irrespective of the digital transaction.

Compton", "date": "October 15, 2021 at 3:38 p.m. EDT", "body": "Tipping is a significant part of culture in the United States. We’re not bound by law to tip, but there’s a social code that compels us to leave a little something when someone helps us out. “Tipping is built into the American economy,” said etiquette expert and author Juliet Mitchell, who goes by “Ms. J.” “Tipping supplements someone’s salary. ... It can be how people earn a living.” That may be why it can feel so terrible when we don’t have cash to tip. Not all of us remember to keep small bills on hand or envelopes of $5 bills in our suitcases like some forward-thinking travelers. Instead, the guilt rises inside us when a valet, bellhop, driver, delivery person or housekeeper does a good job, and we realize we forgot to hit an ATM. That may be a reoccurring discomfort if you’re someone who doesn’t carry cash regularly, which is more common as our global economy becomes increasingly cashless. You’re not, however, doomed to be that traveler who always skips out on a tip. Here are ways to show gratuity, cashless. Do you know how to tip? Take our quiz. If you don’t have cash but you do have a smartphone, consider mobile-payment apps. Venmo, Cash App, PayPal, Zelle and Apple Pay all offer ways to send money quickly and easily. Some of these companies also offer non-mobile ways to pay online; if your smartphone dies, you might be able to access payment services through a laptop or, in desperation, a hotel computer. The practice may feel strange — it’s clunkier than handing someone a few bills — but you wouldn’t be the first person to tip this way. “I’m seeing more and more waiters, entertainers, and other service workers accept Venmo, Paypal, and Zelle for tips — it’s a smart workaround as we become truly cashless,” Molly Fergus, vice president and general manager of the travel planning site TripSavvy, said in an email. While staying in a resort in Aspen, Colo., this summer, Kathy McCabe, host and executive producer of the PBS show “Dream of Italy,” was about to tip when she got a sinking feeling as she realized: She didn’t have any cash. “The bell boy had lugged all of our stuff in a golf cart, so I felt extra bad,” McCabe said in an email. “I asked him if he had a Venmo account, and Venmo’ed him the tip on the spot.” Frank Keller, a senior vice president at PayPal, said that since the pandemic began and some businesses stopped taking cash, the line between physical and digital is blurring even faster, changing the way we shop and pay people. Keller said PayPal and Venmo have integrated a tipping feature into apps with QR codes. The business owner — say, a tour guide or driver — can open their Venmo or PayPal app, pull up their QR code and have a customer scan with their smartphone to tip. On PayPal, tips can be given through a separate “Tip Jar” QR code that doesn’t require a purchase to use. On Venmo, users with a “business profile” can turn on a tipping feature. People who are wary about sending money to a stranger through Venmo may feel more comfortable connecting with a business profile. Meet the people getting paid $10,000 for moving to West Virginia Fergus said mobile-app tipping methods are sometimes preferred to a credit-card gratuity. “Remember that credit cards charge businesses a small percentage of every transaction, and for an independent restaurant or shop, this can be a big expense,” she said. “Whenever you’re able, tip in cash, or use Venmo or PayPal.” Some businesses are adding digital tipping services instead of leaving it up to individual staff members to figure out tips. Chris Chiari, chief executive and owner of the Patterson Inn in Denver, said the boutique hotel has seen interest from guests to have cashless tipping available at checkout. They’re working to make it happen, but the service has proved tricky to implement. “We’ve considered Apple Pay among other cashless trends but are ultimately overwhelmed by the variety of options and do not want to overwhelm the guest,” Chiari said in an email. 4 flight attendants (and a pilot) share their skin-care tips for flying with masks That is where companies such as TipYo and TipX come into play: They work directly with businesses instead of targeting tippers. An avid traveler, Brian Walsh founded TipYo after repeatedly being without cash to tip while on the road. “Nine out of 10 times, I didn’t have cash,” Walsh said. “I thought it was insane I can’t give gratuity by phone.” TipYo launched in 2019, offering hotel brands a way of incorporating secure digital-tipping options into their app or website. In May, Virgin Hotels became the latest to sign on, using TipYo technology through its app Lucy. Virgin Hotels guests can use the Lucy app to tip specific staff members, such as housekeeping or bellhops, throughout their stay. A contactless tipping concept that launched during the pandemic is TipX. Unlike most mobile-payment apps, TipX doesn’t require users to download an app. Customers scan a QR code at the business and select a specific employee to tip. The full tip goes to the employee, and you can leave confidential reviews. TipX is at four hotels and a few businesses in Texas and Florida so far, but the company hopes to expand into sectors such as valet services, public and private transportation. If your wallet only holds cards and no cash — or you’ve switched to a digital wallet completely — carrying around bills becomes an even bigger hassle. At the Driskill Hotel in Austin, director of sales and events Ashley Famalette said that while Venmo is a popular way for guests to tip, she has also seen guests carry gift cards for services such as Uber and DoorDash in lieu of cash tips. If you’re paying for a service with a gift card, keep in mind that not all gift-card transactions allow for tipping, Mitchell said. Before the business runs the card, ask to add tip. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts, there are ways to tip with their preferred coin. Some options go through custodial wallets, which are mobile payments verified by PIN. Twitter even got into the mix in September with the launch of Tips and allows tipping through several methods, including bitcoin, via the interface Strike. While it may feel like tipping is becoming more widespread thanks to digital payment systems, it’s falling off where most of us do it most often — restaurants. A growing number of people in the hospitality industry have been pushing toward eliminating the customer-controlled tip in favor of incorporating a service charge into the check. The service-charge movement accelerated during the pandemic as restaurants re-engineered their operations to survive with fewer customers. The restaurant Leah & Louise in Charlotte said its 23 percent service charge improves employee benefits not only for servers, but also kitchen staff and management. The charge, which it calls the BayHaven Pledge, helps pay for things you would expect from most careers, such as health insurance, paid time off, a 401(k) match and a holiday bonus. On the customer side, the pledge takes out the guesswork and eliminates one more place you have to worry about tipping — in cash or otherwise.

truffles lingered in the air as I wandered up the steep cobbled streets toward the ramparts that lined the edges of Motovun, a fortified medieval hill town on the Istria peninsula in northwestern Croatia. The view was stunning; the green, rolling hills were dotted with vineyards, olive groves and forests, the source of the truffles. It was the second day of my September visit to Istria — my first international trip in 17 months — and it had already exceeded my expectations. I was fully vaccinated and eager to celebrate my 40th birthday abroad by joining a friend who lives in Croatia to explore the country known for its picturesque coastline and ancient walled cities. Our first stop in Motovun was the restaurant across the street from our Airbnb: the inviting stone terrace of Konoba Mondo. I ordered a delicious penne with Sicilian pistachio and Istrian prsut, an air-cured ham. After one bite, my friend exclaimed that the creamy polenta with Parmesan cheese and black truffles that she ordered was the best meal of her life. “Istria cuisine is very much like Italian but heavier,” says Konoba Mondo owner Klaudio Ivasić, who uses his grandmother’s recipes and still lives about 65 feet down the street, in his childhood home. He says the key ingredients are homemade pasta, polenta, Mediterranean spices such as laurel and rosemary, and the famous truffles, which are sourced from the forests around Motovun and the nearby towns of Buzet and Livade. Banned almost everywhere else in Europe, U.S. tourists are finding their way to Croatia The regional cuisine also features some unique local pasta such as fusi, a flat, square noodle rolled up to almost resemble penne, and pljukanci, which are short, thick, twisted noodles. Pasta dishes are often served with prsut, boskarin (beef from local longhorn cattle), wild asparagus and seafood in coastal areas. Another integral part of the cuisine is wine, which is most often made with Teran (red) or Malvazija (white) grapes. Because Motovun is tiny, we spent our days exploring the peninsula’s interior and narrow, winding roads by car. Although every hill appeared to be topped with a medieval town or an abandoned castle, I never tired of either. We wandered the ruins of Pietrapelosa castle; the streets of Hum, the self-proclaimed smallest town in the world; and Dvigrad, Istria’s largest complex of medieval ruins, which were destroyed by multiple sieges and the plague. In between sights, we snuck in an olive oil and wine tasting at Ipsa, a family-owned business with a shaded patio overlooking the vineyards, and learned about Istria’s complex identity. When I arrived at sunrise to photograph the city of Rovinj, for example, the scene could have been mistaken for Venice.  I set up my tripod and waited for the sun to highlight the Italian bell tower on a hill above a row of colorful buildings lining the water. The likeness to Venice (if I had removed the hill and added some gondolas) was not a coincidence; the Republic of Venice ruled this coastal town for five centuries.  After the Venetian rule ended in the 18th century, its influence remained in the architecture and culture. The winged lion of St. Mark, the emblem for the Venetian Republic, was a common sight in Rovinj and across the peninsula. The cobbled streets and laundry lines strung from balconies made me nostalgic for Venice, which I visited as a college student in the early 2000s, on my first trip to Europe — a trip that would later ignite a life and career of travel. Two decades later, I wandered the streets of Rovinj in the same state of awe at the elaborate architecture, clicking my camera’s shutter at every corner. Aside from architecture, the other element Rovinj shares with Venice is the crowds; the streets were packed with tourists and vendors selling paintings and other trinkets. Every cafe was overflowing at sunset. I had naively thought that, by traveling after peak season, I would miss the crowds. Because Croatia is open to travelers who meet either vaccination or testing requirements, this wasn’t the case. As an added safety precaution, I dined only outdoors and wore a mask indoors and focused on outdoor attractions. In addition to the Venetians, the Romans, Byzantines, Slavs and Austrians ruled Istria at times, as they did much of Croatia’s coast. The only exception was after World War I, when Istria became part of Italy while the majority of modern-day Croatia became part of Yugoslavia. It joined Yugoslavia after World War II. For a deeper look into the region’s tangled history, I reached out to Wollfy Krasić, assistant professor for the Department of Demography and Croatian Emigration at the University of Zagreb. “Istria today undoubtedly has a Croatian identity but also a strong regional identity, which is due to the fact that, although the Croatian population was numerically predominant in Istria for centuries, Istria was not part of the Croatian state (as part of communist Yugoslavia) until the end of the World War II,” Krasić wrote via email. “As for the most famous cultural monuments, they were created in the Roman, Byzantine and Venetian periods, although there are exceptions.” Kayaking through the past in Dubrovnik, Croatia The Italian heritage is an integral part of regional culture. Krasić points out that seven towns and 12 municipalities in Istria County are officially bilingual, which means “not only bilingual street signs or the presence of schools where the language of instruction is Italian, but also the translation into Italian of all official documents of the local administration.” I frequently spotted these bilingual street signs in small hill towns such as Groznjan and in Pula, Istria County’s largest city. The road signs along major highways were also in both languages. One of the most interesting examples of this heritage was in the center of Pula, an important outpost of the Roman Empire known for an amphitheater built during the same time frame as the Colosseum in Rome. Forum Square, which has served as the town’s main square since the reign of the Roman Empire, features the crumbling Temple of Augustus, built during the rule of Augustus Caesar. The temple stands beside the medieval town hall that flies the flags of Istria, Croatia, the European Union and Italy — a visual representation of Istria’s identity. I spent my last night in Istria pondering the complexities of the region while hunting for the perfect dinner spot in Rovinj. My friend had left earlier in the day to return to the southern Croatian city of Split, and I managed to snag a seat for one at the last minute at La Puntulina, a Michelin Guide-listed restaurant. Its photogenic terrace, which spreads across the rocks along the water’s edge, is the most coveted dinner spot in town. The fusi pasta with boskarin was one of the best meals of my trip. Although the historic influences are obvious, Istria, like the rest of Croatia, has a distinctive culture apparent in everything, including the food, the wine and the extremely friendly and welcoming people — such as the determined hostess who set up a makeshift table for me with a perfect sunset view at La Puntulina. As the sun slipped slowly into the clear blue water, I sipped on a chilled glass of Teran — a dry red wine — happy to be traveling again despite the crowds and already looking forward to a return trip to Croatia. \n Mazurek is a writer based in Austin.

Joe Thomas: Though some might not expect it, it's a low-scoring affair between the Browns and Cardinals on Sunday. Baker Mayfield has modest numbers, but authors that signature come-from-behind moment. Trailing late in the fourth quarter, Mayfield leads the Browns down the field for the winning score as time expires. James Jones: The Detroit Lions have been thisclose to winning two games this season. They would already be in the win column if not for a pair of last-second field goals: a record-setting boot from Baltimore's Justin Tucker in Week 3 and a 54-yarder from Minnesota's Greg Joseph in Week 5. Detroit won't have to wait any longer for its first victory of the season, as the Lions take down the 3-2 Bengals in Ford Field. DeAngelo Hall: Until now, the Buffalo Bills' defense has suffocated opposing rushers. The unit has not allowed 50 or more ground yards to a running back this season -- the most it allowed was 61 to QB Patrick Mahomes last week. But against the best running back in the league, Derrick Henry, the Bills become vulnerable. The two-time reigning rushing champion has run for at least 130 yards and one TD in consecutive games; over the last 10 years, per NFL Research, only Henry (2019) and Adrian Peterson (2012) have reached those figures in three straight outings. The Titans superstar does it again in style, rumbling for 150-plus yards and two scores on Buffalo. Maurice Jones-Drew: You want bold?! I'll give you BOLD. Chase Claypool found his game last week against the Broncos with five receptions for 130 yards and his first receiving TD of the season. This week vs. Seattle, the second-year wideout puts on a show and has 100 receiving yards and THREE touchdowns! Marc Ross: The Arizona Cardinals kept their undefeated record intact last week with a gritty win over the 49ers. This week, however, it's a different story. The Browns' top-ranked ground attack rolls over a Cardinals defense that ranks 29th vs. the run, as Kareem Hunt will eclipse 125 yards rushing.

The streak stopped at 43 -- tied with the Pittsburgh Steelers of 1974-77 for the all-time record -- and was primarily led by Lamar Jackson. The electric quarterback led the league's top rushing offense in 2019 and 2020. Kudos to Jackson and Co. for making history, but I'm setting QBs aside for now (this is the RB Index after all) and focusing on rushing duos this week. Specifically, running back duos. Below are my top five running back tandems in the league heading into Week 6. Running backs: Nick Chubb and Kareem Hunt  Kevin Stefanski has it figured out. His outside zone scheme was already quarterback-friendly, and it's even more so with a pair of Pro Bowl running backs in the backfield. In his first season as head coach, the Browns' third-ranked run game helped the team end a near-two decade playoff drought. One year later, the run game has become the league standard. Chubb and Hunt have combined for 1,002 scrimmage yards and nine scrimmage touchdowns this season, making them only the third RB duo over the last 30 seasons to combine for at least 1,000 yards and eight TDs through their team's first five games of a season. The Browns don't have to change the game plan based on which player is on the field. Both Chubb and Hunt pose a major threat to defenses when running inside or outside the tackles or catching the ball out of the backfield.  UPDATE: Nick Chubb has been ruled out of Sunday's game with a calf injury, the team announced Friday. Running backs: Ezekiel Elliott and Tony Pollard  As great as Dak Prescott and Co. have been in the passing attack, offensive coordinator Kellen Moore has continued to lean on the run game with a two-back system. The Cowboys' second-ranked rushing attack is taking a lot of pressure off Prescott by forcing the defense to honor the run, leading the veteran QB to play some of his best football. Zeke came into this season in shape and he's performing like it, while Pollard has been more consistently productive in an expanded role. The Cowboys are the only team with multiple players in the top 10 in rushing with Elliott ranking third with 452 rush yards and Pollard landing 10th with 325 rush yards.  Running backs: Dalvin Cook and Alexander Mattison  The Vikings have a pair of homegrown talents in their backfield with Cook (second-round pick in 2017) and Mattison (third-rounder in 2019). When healthy, Cook is the engine that makes all things go for the Vikings' offense. His success (or lack thereof) directly impacts Kirk Cousins and the passing attack. Since 2017, Cook has averaged 113.7 scrimmage yards per game, second-most in the NFL in that span. However, he's battled an ankle injury early this season and missed Weeks 3 and 5 while playing limited snaps in Week 4. Mattison has stepped up in those games (both wins), logging 150-plus scrimmage yards in each contest. In fact, Mattison is the only player in the NFL this season with multiple games of at least 100 rush yards and 40 receiving yards -- Derrick Henry is the only other player with one such game. Knowing Mattison can handle the load as the offense's primary back while Cook heals must put the team and fan base at ease. Running backs: Devin Singletary and Zack Moss  The Bills have trotted out a rejuvenated ground game in 2021 after ranking 20th in the league in rushing a year ago. Quarterback Josh Allen is a tremendous threat with his legs and will likely be able to get the offense out of precarious situations by utilizing his running ability, but the improvement of Singletary and Moss five weeks into the season is great to see. The Bills are averaging 140.4 rush yards per contest (fifth in the NFL) and their young running backs have provided some much-needed balance to Brian Daboll's unit. I've seen the most improvement from Singletary, who's averaging 5.2 yards per carry and leads the team in carries and rush yards. Moss has been a major asset in the red zone with a team-high three rush TDs. Running backs: Melvin Gordon and Javonte Williams  Gordon, a seventh-year pro, is averaging 4.7 rush yards per carry, more than half a yard more than his career per carry mark. He fits the downhill running style Vic Fangio wants, but the offense is also getting a boost from Williams. The rookie is getting better each week as he adjusts to the speed and physicality of the game. With star receivers in and out of the lineup due to injury, this RB duo is essential to Teddy Bridgewater and the Broncos' offensive success. The Broncos currently rank 12th in the league in rushing, and I won't be surprised to see this unit produce at an even higher level as Williams, whom I really liked coming out of North Carolina, gets more comfortable.  Former NFL rushing leader and NFL Network analyst Maurice Jones-Drew will survey all running backs and rank his top 15 each week of the 2021 season. His rankings are based on this season's efforts alone. Here is MJD's list heading into Week 6. NOTE: Arrows reflect changes from last week's rankings. 2021 stats: 5 games | 142 att | 640 rush yds | 4.51 ypc | 7 rush TD | 14 rec | 125 rec yds | 0 rec TD | 0 fumbles   Henry has career highs in carries, rush yards and rush TDs through the first five weeks of a season. The production we're seeing from him year over year is something special. He'll have a major test Monday night against Sean McDermott's No. 1 overall defense. 2021 stats: 5 games | 90 att | 523 rush yds | 5.81 ypc | 4 rush TD | 5 rec | 35 rec yds | 0 rec TD | 1 fumbleï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿  Chubb is already halfway to his 2021 rushing yards total. With the fifth-year veteran averaging 104.6 rush yards per game, it's no wonder the Browns feature the NFL's best run offense.  UPDATE: Nick Chubb has been ruled out of Sunday's game with a calf injury, the team announced Friday. 2021 stats: 5 games | 85 att | 452 rush yds | 5.32 ypc | 5 rush TDs | 9 rec | 55 rec yds | 1 rec TD | 0 fumblesï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿  With last week's outing against the Giants, Zeke has strung together back-to-back 100-yard rushing games for the first time since Weeks 6-9 of 2019. This is the consistency Dallas has been looking for in its run game. 2021 stats: 5 games | 94 att | 368 rush yds | 3.91 ypc | 1 rush TD | 15 rec | 113 rec yds | 3 rec TDs | 0 fumbles  After having zero targets in Week 4, Kamara was more involved in the passing game in the Saints' victory over Washington. He tied for a team-high eight targets and had a team-high five receptions for 51 yards and one receiving TD. Sean Payton must continue to lean on his most dynamic player after the team's Week 6 bye.ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ 2021 stats: 5 games | 70 att | 309 rush yds | 4.41 ypc | 2 rush TDs | 17 rec | 132 rec yds | 3 rec TD | 1 fumble  Jones is finding his stride as we near midseason. He logged a season-high 103 rush yards in last weekend's thriller vs. the Bengals, and has posted at least 90 scrimmage yards in each of the last four games. Even with stars Aaron Rodgers and Davante Adams in the mix, Packers are at their very best when Jones is heavily involved and producing.ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ 2021 stats: 5 games | 67 att | 349 rush yds | 5.21 ypc | 4 rush TD | 23 rec | 194 rec yds | 3 rec TD | 0 fumbles   Ekeler is on a tear this season and is one of the reasons the Chargers sit at the top of the AFC West. Having recorded at least 100 scrimmage yards in every game since Week 2, Ekeler tied his career high with three scrimmage touchdowns (two rush, one receiving) in Sunday's win over the Browns. He's the perfect asset for rising superstar Justin Herbert.ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ 2021 stats: 5 games | 93 att | 386 rush yds | 4.15 ypc | 3 rush TD | 8 rec | 31 rec yds | 0 rec TD | 0 fumblesï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿  Battling an ankle injury, Mixon shared the load with Samaje Perine against the Packers but came through late in regulation with an 8-yard TD run that, with a successful two-point conversion, sent the game to overtime. Mixon's been limited in practice this week but hopefully his injury won't sideline him for Sunday's game against a hungry Detroit team. 2021 stats: 5 games | 73 att | 327 rush yds | 4.48 ypc | 2 rush TD | 14 rec | 197 rec yds | 1 rec TD | 0 fumbles ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿  Taylor had an incredible performance Monday night, and it should've been enough for the Colts to notch their second win of the season. The second-year back had a career-high 116 receiving yards thanks to this dynamic, 76-yard catch-and-run TD in the first quarter. I love to see young backs flash different part of their skill sets, and the passing game is an area in which Frank Reich might want to utilize him more. 2021 stats: 5 games | 55 att | 295 rush yds | 5.36 ypc | 5 rush TDs | 17 rec | 149 rec yds | 0 rec TD | 0 fumbles  ï»¿ï»¿The Browns scored a season-high 42 points against the Chargers last weekend and Hunt accounted for two scores on the ground, including an 8-yard TD run in the fourth quarter that gave the Browns a late lead. Hunt's five TD runs this season are tied for second-most entering Week 6.  2021 stats: 5 games | 51 att | 325 rush yds | 6.37 ypc | 1 rush TD | 12 rec | 93 rec yds | 0 rec TD | 0 fumbles ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿  Pollard is steadily climbing the ranks after consistently showing out for Dallas each week. He leads all running backs in yards per carry (6.4) and routinely puts the Cowboys in favorable positions. 2021 stats: 5 games | 67 att | 387 rush yds | 5.78 ypc | 4 rush TD | 14 rec | 88 rec yds | 0 rec TD | 0 fumbles  ï»¿ï»¿Robinson was one of the best surprises to come out of the 2020 season, and he's continued that momentum in Year 2. Last week against the Titans, he had a career-high 149 rush yards and is tied for the fourth-most rush yards in the league after five weeks. 2021 stats: 5 games | 56 att | 251 rush yds | 4.48 ypc | 1 rush TD | 19 rec | 167 rec yds | 0 rec TD | 0 fumbles  ï»¿Fournette has found his place in Tampa's offense, averaging just under 5.0 yards per carry over the last two games. This is the type of production that will help the Bucs' offense better control the clock and keep their injury-riddled defense from wearing down late in games. 2021 stats: 5 games | 65 att | 258 rush yds | 3.97 ypc | 0 rush TD | 15 rec | 120 rec yds | 1 rec TD | 1 fumble  Mattison filled the void in the backfield left by Dalvin Cook during Weeks 3 and 5. As the starter, he registered 171 scrimmage yards in Minnesota's Week 3 win over Seattle and 153 scrimmage yards and a receiving TD in Sunday's win over Detroit. Cook is hard to replace, but Mattison has risen to the occasion. 2021 stats: 5 games | 78 att | 307 rush yds | 3.94 ypc | 2 rush TD | 28 rec | 198 rec yds | 1 rec TD | 0 fumbles  ï»¿ï»¿The Steelers finally wised up and leaned on their rookie running back, and it resulted in a much-needed W. Against the Broncos, Harris logged a career-high 23 carries for 122 rush yards and a TD after averaging 13.8 carries and 46.3 rush yards per game in Weeks 1-4. This is the formula that will keep Pittsburgh trending upward after a rough start. 2021 stats: 5 games | 49 att | 270 rush yds | 5.51 ypc | 0 rush TD | 23 rec | 159 rec yds | 0 rec TD | 0 fumblesï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿  Edmonds is hanging on by a thread in the No. 15 spot as James Conner is picking up a lot of steam as midseason approaches. Conner has scored five rush TDs over the last three games. Edmonds has to do something more to maintain his place as the starter and on my list.

NFL Writer Through five weeks of the 2021 NFL season, we've encountered some genuine surprises from a collection of unheralded talents. It's about time I give them some praise. First, I want to make clear I'm focusing on true jaw-droppers here. So you won't see Mike Williams, who was a 1,000-yard receiver two seasons ago, and who was bound to produce in Year 2 with Justin Herbert, especially with his usage in new coordinator Joe Lombardi's offense. Anyone who has paid attention to the Dallas Cowboys saw something like this big year coming from Tony Pollard. Cooper Kupp has been a key part of the Rams' offense since he arrived in 2017, and apparently was only a few brunches from becoming his quarterback's favorite target. Deebo Samuel likely would have posted strong numbers if he and his quarterback were healthy last season, though his current production exceeds expectation. And D.J. Moore has broken 1,100 receiving yards in each of his last two seasons. Oh, and there were a ton of Bills candidates -- perhaps the most complete team in the NFL at this point -- but in the interest of not giving too many players credit for one team's success, I went with their greatest surprise of all and best inspiration for a range of Twitter puns. Turn out the lights and hide. Everyone be quiet. Got your party horns and confetti? Here they come ... get ready to hit the lights and shout. SURPRISE! Here are the top surprises through five weeks: Patterson has been a total revelation for the Falcons during his first season in Atlanta -- and precisely no one saw this coming. First off, after averaging more than twice as many targets (41) as carries (20.9) in his first eight pro seasons, Patterson is now primarily a running back, and with 173 rushing yards in five games so far, he's already near his career high (232, set last year) in a single season. More importantly, his versatility has made him a weapon out of the backfield and split out wide, as Patterson is the only player in the NFL with at least one receiving touchdown from every target depth (behind the line of scrimmage, short, intermediate and deep) this season. Matt Ryan hasn't been afraid to target Patterson no matter where he lines up, throwing four touchdown passes to him in their first five games together, including a three-touchdown outing in a high-flying loss to Washington in Week 4. The Falcons have a ways to go in terms of improving their roster, but the former first-round pick's contributions in his age-30 season have made this team an exciting watch on a weekly basis. Diggs landed on our list of potential first-time MVP candidates last week, and he only continues to build his case with each week. Diggs recorded yet another interception in Week 5, bringing his total to a league-high six and marking his fifth straight game in which he picked off an opposing passer at least once. He's on pace to record an outrageous 20 interceptions in 2021 -- and while most would see that as unsustainable, it remains possible at this point. He's shutting down expected completions, too, recording the second-lowest completion rate over expected allowed at -18.1 percent. Only Buffalo's Taron Johnson is better in that regard. Boosted by his interception total, Diggs is dominating target expected points allowed at -29, nearly twice as many as the next-closest defender. Diggs' penchant for takeaways has vaulted him toward the top of the ranks of game-changing cornerbacks. Most expected improvement from the second-rounder in his second NFL season, but nothing like this. Chase spent the first month of the season calming preseason doubts about his hands. Since then, he's already graduated to the next level, becoming a reliable big-play producer on a weekly basis -- Chase has caught at least one touchdown pass in all but one of his first five games. He's already tied the record for most deep receiving touchdown receptions (four) by a rookie in a season since the Next Gen Stats era began in 2016, and he still has 12 games to play. Chase's latest performance was his best in terms of yardage (159 on six receptions), and it included a 70-yard touchdown grab that pulled the Bengals to within two points of the Packers just before halftime. Chase is closing in on 500 receiving yards for the season, and he's on pace to score 17 receiving touchdowns. He's clearly Cincinnati's top target after just five career games and is quickly proving that the Bengals made the right choice between him and Penei Sewell with the fifth overall pick in the draft. Hargrave has been a menace in the interior for the Eagles, who are receiving an incredible rate of production from their 2020 free-agent signing. Hargrave is already a half sack from matching his single-season high (6.5). He's forced one fumble (recovered by Fletcher Cox for a touchdown in Week 3). And he's matched his career high in tackles for loss (seven). A dive into the Next Gen Stats reveal an even more astounding fact: Hargrave's current QB pressure rate of 21 percent is the highest for an interior defensive lineman with a minimum of 100 pass-rush snaps in the history of the NGS era (dating back to 2016). We knew Hargrave was an effective interior lineman, but not like this. He's become a force for Philadelphia -- and that's a welcome development for a defense that is still figuring out how to best utilize Cox in new coordinator Jonathan Gannon's first season at the helm. Week 5 was Dawson's Week -- and his five-touchdown start to the season might just end up being Dawson's Peak. Either way, Buffalo will take it. Knox is on pace to smash his previous career high for receiving yardage (388, set in his rookie season in 2019), racking up 261 through five games, and he's already shattered his previous ceiling for receiving touchdowns (three). Knox teamed up with Josh Allen to make some Next Gen Stats history Sunday night in Kansas City, catching a 53-yard touchdown pass to help Allen become the first quarterback of the NGS era to be perfect and top 170 yards while posting two TDs on deep attempts in a single half. Knox made some history of his own against the Chiefs, becoming the first tight end to record three deep receptions in any game in the Next Gen era. His three touchdowns on targets of 10-19 air yards are tied with Indianapolis' Zach Pascal for the most this season in the entire league. Knox has evolved from a traditional tight end who might make a key grab every once in a while to a legitimate option in an offense filled with them. (Stefon Diggs and Emmanuel Sanders, anyone?) Defenses might want to be extra careful to not allow him to slip into open space for another episode of Dawson's Leak. As a rookie edge rusher, Oweh is already well beyond what most figured to see from him in 2021, even taking into account the higher expectations that come with being a first-round pick. Oweh made a key play in a frantic comeback win over the Chiefs in Week 2, forcing Clyde Edwards-Helaire to fumble with the game on the line. He did it again in Monday's win over the Colts, forcing Carson Wentz to fumble via strip-sack, giving the ball back to Baltimore and taking away a red-zone opportunity from Indianapolis. Oweh is tied with Cardinals edge rusher Chandler Jones for the most turnovers caused by pressure this season with three, and he's currently tied with Joey Bosa in total quarterback pressures with 18. Oweh is just as effective against the run, tying with a handful of defenders (including Aaron Donald) for the fourth-most run stuffs with six. His arrival has bolstered Baltimore's defense up front, making the Ravens a difficult matchup for any team. Landry had a field day against the Colts in Week 3, generating a career-high 12 quarterback pressures in Tennessee's win over Indianapolis. His pressure rate in that one tied for the third-highest mark in a game in the Next Gen Stats era, propelling him to the top of the leaderboard for total QB pressures (26) through five weeks. The 2018 second-rounder is well on his way to surpassing his single-season high for sacks (nine), having recorded 4.5 in five games, and he's added some needed juice to the edge rush for Tennessee. A lot of Landry's production came from that stellar Week 3 performance, but it set a new bar Landry can strive toward. And if the Titans can get something similar from Landry through the rest of the season, they'll be more than pleased with him. We all know the narrative surrounding the Ravens at this point: Sure, Baltimore can run it with the best of them, but can Lamar Jackson throw them to victory on a consistent basis? Well, Monday night's comeback provided an answer for those asking that question, and Brown again had a lot to do with the result. The receiver nicknamed \"Hollywood\" caught nine passes for 125 yards and two touchdowns, including the game-winning score, and he's strung together a couple of key performances to help the Ravens rattle off four straight wins. The 2019 first-rounder came into the year averaging 3.5 catches and 45.1 yards per game; it seems as if all he needed was a competent cast of fellow receivers and a bit of a playbook expansion on the part of offensive coordinator Greg Roman -- oh, and to rediscover his own hands -- to take the next step toward becoming Baltimore's legitimate No. 1 pass catcher. He's using his speed to win downfield, earning an open-target rate of 40 percent on deep passes (tied for first with the Chargers' Mike Williams, among those with a minimum of 10 such targets), and he's making the plays in between. We're watching Brown figure it out in real time, and the Ravens are reaping the rewards. Preseason often doesn't mean much, but sometimes it gives us a peek at what could be ahead -- and that was the case with Callaway, who has carried his buzzy preseason performance into his first season catching passes from Jameis Winston full-time. As a rookie last season, he finished with 21 catches for 213 yards and zero receiving TDs -- he's already set a new career high for receiving yards (222) and touchdowns (three), and he's closing in on receptions (he has 13 through five games). He's not the only unknown Saint to make a difference -- tight end Juwan Johnson has three touchdown catches in five games -- but he's quickly becoming a weapon for a Saints offense still figuring out its identity. Callaway's two receiving touchdowns in Week 5 -- including a scoring reception on a Hail Mary that was the most improbable touchdown in the NFL this season -- made Michael Thomas' absence a little bit easier to bear. This choice relies more on the tape than the numbers, but if you've tuned into Lions games this season, there's a good chance you've seen Walker make a few plays. In fact, the fourth-year pro has been all over the field for Detroit, racking up 25 tackles (two for loss), one sack and two passes defensed through five games. As a safety, he doesn't see a ton of targets as the nearest defender, but when opponents do throw in his direction, he's been effective. Walker has posted the highest ballhawk rate (22.2 percent) of any Lions defensive back with at least five targets, and he's denying 12.4 percent of expected completions on nine total targets. Even better: Walker has been a valuable asset against the run, ranking fourth among all defensive backs (minimum 120 run-defense snaps) in run-stop rate and sixth in run-stuff rate. Walker is a Pro Football Focus darling through five weeks, earning the second-highest grade among all safeties at 83.5, a mark powered by his strong run-defense grade (86.2). Again, his stat totals might not get much snazzier, given his position, but he should continue to jump off the screen.

Bowl prospects at midseason", "author": "Chad Reuter", "date": "Oct 14, 2021 at 03:57 PM", "body": "Draft Analyst We've reached the midway point of the college football regular season, cresting like we're on a roller coaster and ready to throw our arms into the air for the fast descent into bowl season. There are six newcomers this week to my list of the top prospects for the 2022 Reese's Senior Bowl. These stars, plus a dozen more prospects with the talent to make their way into my top 25, have played well enough over the past six weeks (as well as in previous years) to be picked in the first 75 overall selections next year. The 2022 draft is still six months away (April 28-30 in Las Vegas), so the evaluations of these players will change based on their play as the season unfolds, their results in athletic testing and, if they are fortunate enough to receive an invite, their performance in Senior Bowl week practices and the game itself (Feb. 5 on NFL Network). One player from my initial list, Alabama edge rusher Christopher Allen, is not included here because he broke his foot while strip-sacking Miami Hurricanes quarterback D'Eriq King in the season opener and is unlikely to play again this year. NOTE: Prospects are listed in ascending order. Heights and weights are via school measurements. Previous rank: Not ranked Austin, who also runs track for the Tigers, is the football team's top offensive threat, ranking among FBS leaders with 139.5 receiving yards per game and eight receiving touchdowns. With 13 receptions for 200 yards last week against Tulsa, he showed scouts his ability to eat grass against soft coverage, beat press with quickness off the line and excel in the quick-screen game. Austin's lone score came late in the game, finding the hole against Cover 2. He converted a fourth-and-11 on the next series, taking away linebacker angles with his extreme speed on a shallow cross. Austin's lack of size and occasional drops might scare off some teams, but similar prospects Tutu Atwell, D'Wayne Eskridge, and Rondale Moore were all selected in the second round of the 2021 draft. UPDATE: Austin had a 69-yard TD run and two catches for 20 yards in Memphis' 35-17 win over Navy on Thursday night. Previous rank: Not ranked Brooks' performance last week against Texas in the Red River Showdown (25 carries for 217 yards and two TDs) reminded everyone of his 1,000-yard seasons in 2018 and 2019 (he opted out of the 2020 season). He got the Sooners' offense going after they fell behind 14-0 early, running for 15 yards after feeling his way through traffic in the middle and then accelerating for the gain. That was a theme throughout the contest for Brooks, who patiently waited for his blocks and then used his low pad level, forward lean and powerful legs to push through tackle attempts in the backfield and second level. His 65-yard jaunt late in the third quarter (getting his knee to the ground before the ball was stripped) set up a touchdown, but Brooks' two fourth-quarter scores are the plays that fans will long remember. He ran as strong and fast on those direct-snap carries down the left numbers as he did in the first quarter -- a fact that won't evade NFL scouts. Previous rank: Not ranked McBride's combination of quickness off the line, receiving prowess and blocking intensity is something rarely seen in the college game nowadays. He passed his toughest test to date against Iowa's defense three weeks ago. McBride had two battles against safety Jack Koerner in the third quarter, once losing a third-down catch to Koerner's physicality and then exhibiting excellent concentration to snag a sideline pass tipped by Koerner while keeping his feet in bounds for a 15-yard gain. McBride showed off athleticism and awareness on one uncontested out route, turning upfield quickly and jumping to extend the ball past the first down marker before getting forced out of bounds. The Colorado native stood up to the Hawkeyes as an in-line blocker, putting defensive end Zach VanValkenburg to the turf on a run play late in the first half, and also showed NFL teams he can be a tenacious move blocker from the H-back position. Previous rank: Not ranked Paschal is a cancer survivor, undergoing surgeries and immunotherapy treatment in 2018 for a malignant lesion found on the bottom of his right foot. He has bounced back to become a major factor in Kentucky's 6-0 start this season, racking up 7.5 tackles for loss (including 1.5 sacks) and leading the team in wins over Florida and LSU the past two weekends. Paschal did a bit of everything in those wins. He freed up linebackers by eating up double teams with his excellent quickness off the snap and strong lower body. He also shed linemen to harass quarterbacks and tackle running backs, bringing down LSU star wideout Kayshon Boutte on a jet sweep, and even blocked a Florida field goal attempt that was returned for a touchdown by Kentucky. Some teams might find an issue fitting Paschal into their scheme. He could grow into a five-technique, but teams willing to live with his lack of prototypical height on the edge will pick up a true disruptor. Previous rank: Not ranked Texas came up short against Oklahoma in another classic Red River Showdown at the Cotton Bowl, but Overshown showed up to play. On OU's first series, he sacked quarterback Spencer Rattler on a third-down blitz and then blocked a punt by pushing a protector backwards and extending his long arm skyward. He recovered a Rattler fumble in the second quarter, after which true freshman passer Caleb Williams took over and eventually led the Sooners' comeback. The tall, lean defender reminds me of longtime Texans starting inside linebacker Zach Cunningham, bringing physicality between the tackles and pursuing the ball all over the field, even at the cost of missing one or two tackles a game. Previous rank: No. 13 Jobe was not challenged often in the Tide's Week 5 dismantling of Ole Miss. He stayed with whichever receiver was sent his way, playing press early on and softening up later to prevent big plays. A couple of open-field tackle attempts eluded him. Jobe was flagged for pass interference near the end of the game as he held up his receiver a bit after the two collided on a post-corner. Last week's road loss to Texas A&M did not start out great for Jobe, as he vacated his third of the field in Cover 3, allowing a wide-open Jalen Wydermyer to score the Aggies' first touchdown. He was part of a coverage issue with the Tide's linebackers on A&M's second score and was also flagged for a weak holding call late in the third quarter. Jobe handled his man-cover responsibilities throughout the game just fine, however, and broke up a third-down pass (arriving a wee bit early) while in zone midway through the fourth quarter. Previous rank: No. 17 Salyer and the rest of the Georgia offensive linemen exerted their will on the Arkansas defense in Week 5, running for 273 yards in the 37-0 victory. He regularly attacked his assignment, latching on so defenders could not break away. Salyer got a hand on a linebacker to free James Cook on a first-quarter sideline run and hit second-level targets on other occasions. The Bulldogs ran behind him twice for touchdowns, one where he crashed the edge so star defensive tackle-moonlighting-as-a-fullback Jalen Carter could lead the way. Salyer suffered an ankle injury midway through the second quarter against Auburn last week, but not before helping the Bulldogs get an early 17-3 lead with strong run blocking. Head coach Kirby Smart said after the game that Salyer thought he could go back in the game, but redshirt freshman Broderick Jones was playing well enough that coaches did not need to force the issue. Previous rank: Not ranked The Crimson Tide were not gracious hosts to Ole Miss two weeks ago, beating them 42-21 in a game that wasn't as close as the score indicated. Mathis used his length and power to eat blocks at the nose tackle spot while also working hard to play the run at the five-technique. He missed a sack on athletic quarterback Matt Corral early, but had his revenge late in the second quarter, twisting outside and pushing aside a tight end to earn a strip-sack that was recovered by Alabama. Texas A&M provided similar hospitality in College Station last week, ending the Tide's 19-game winning streak. Mathis did his part, though, tossing aside single blocks and working through double-teams to get to the ball. His hustle outside the box on stretch plays, quarterback scrambles and quick passes was impressive for his size, as were his violent hands and ability to cross the face of his blocker to win gaps. Previous rank: No. 12 South Carolina let Troy hang around in a 23-14 home win two weeks ago, but Enagbare was a thorn in the Trojans' side all day. He consistently shed single blocks and double-teams, and also bull-rushed tackles into the backfield. While Enagbare was credited with two quarterback hurries, that number could have been tripled -- though he had no sacks because the quarterback unloaded the ball under pressure. He also reached his long arms into passing lanes, dropped into coverage and kept his eyes open for misdirection and screens, showing scouts he's not just a pass rusher. Enagbare had a smaller impact last week against Tennessee in the Gamecocks' 45-20 road loss, however. Between the Volunteers' fast-paced offense and the elusiveness of quarterback Hendon Hooker, it was tough for him to get to the ball most of the day even if he beat his block. Enagbare was credited with a sack when storming in on a handoff in the first half and won with power and speed at times in the second half, but by then, the game's outcome was already determined. Previous rank: No. 15 The Buckeyes rotated defensive linemen throughout their destruction of Rutgers (52-13) and Maryland (66-17), so Garrett only managed to record two tackles total in the two games. He was his usual quick self off the snap and held his ground against the run. Garrett's biggest play against Rutgers was an extra-point block late in the first quarter. The next week, he chased Terps quarterback Taulia Tagovailoa multiple times, shedding his man with brute strength. With the team up 49-10 midway through the third quarter, however, Garrett needed help leaving the field and wasn't putting weight on his right leg. Head coach Ryan Day noted after the game that it was an issue Garrett had been dealing with for a while, and there's optimism he'll be back after the team's upcoming bye week. Previous rank: No. 14 The highly anticipated battle between Faalele and Purdue edge rusher George Karlaftis did not materialize in Week 5, as they only faced each other a few times in the first half and the Gophers put an H-back on the right side when Karlaftis lined up there in the rain-soaked second half. Faalele played well in the 20-13 Minnesota win, controlling his man in pass pro and using his bulk to wall off defenders in the run game. He's not just a bull off the ball, though, as he has the foot quickness to get to necessary blocking angles. The Gophers had last week off to prepare for a Nebraska squad stung by a close loss to Michigan on Saturday night. Previous rank: No. 11 Penn State's top receiver scored twice in the 24-0 rout of Indiana two weeks ago. He once again flaunted his excellent catch radius by reaching high for a throw near the back of the end zone early in the second quarter. Dotson scored in the third quarter, as well, thanks to a mesh play that left him wide open for a 30-yard scamper. While his lack of bulk makes it difficult for him to block or break tackles after the catch, few receivers are better in space with the ball in their hands. He accelerated between blockers for a 16-yard punt return in the fourth quarter but got down quickly and limped a bit to the sideline at the end of his night. Dotson struggled to find room to run last week in Penn State's loss to Iowa, especially after starting quarterback Sean Clifford exited the game with an injury in the second quarter. He and Clifford found a rhythm early on, throwing the ball outside against the Hawkeyes' zone to move the chains. Backup passer Ta'Quan Roberson only connected with Dotson a couple times for 5 total yards. Previous rank: No. 10 Penning exerted his dominance two weeks ago against Youngstown State in Northern Iowa's 34-7 victory. Defensive tackles couldn't move him, while smaller edge rushers were smothered by his length and lateral agility. He showed off his mobility while leading a big off-tackle run to the left sideline, clearing out a defensive back in his way. Officials called Penning for a personal foul late in the third quarter, however, as he shoved a defender after the whistle. He found himself on the sideline for the rest of the lopsided affair. Penning played more under control last week against North Dakota State, stopping rushers in their tracks and pounding defenders in the run game. He was called for two false starts, though, and allowed hits on his quarterback in the second half of the team's 34-20 loss when missing a twist on one play and giving up the corner on occasion. Previous rank: No. 21 The Utes, fresh off a bye week, took down USC at the Coliseum last weekend, 42-26. Lloyd began the game as an edge defender. He played with his hand down and stood up against the left tackle, too. He was physical at the point of attack, knocked down a pass when left unblocked and beat a tight end with quick hands to stop former Texas running back Keaontay Ingram before he bounced outside. Lloyd moved back to his usual middle linebacker spot late in the first half, where he remained for nearly all of the final two quarters (with the exception of two plays when he was back at the rush spot near the end of the game). He dropped into coverage as USC threw often in an effort to get back into the contest, matched up with running backs out of the backfield and shed blocks to prevent explosive plays. Previous rank: No. 22 Johnson was a rock in pass protection in Boston College's near-upset at Clemson two weeks ago. The left guard stopped pass rushers in their tracks and looked like the former left tackle he is when blocking in space. He was shed once in the run game early on, but usually dropped his hips and drove his man back or turned his shoulders. Johnson took out a linebacker in space on RB Pat Garwo II's touchdown run early in the second half, undoubtedly endearing himself to NFL offensive line coaches who value mobility. The Eagles did not play last week but will host N.C. State on Saturday. Previous rank: No. 20 Brisker was not involved in a lot of plays in the Nittany Lions' blowout of Indiana a couple weeks ago, but he showed off his ability in coverage, blanketing a third-down out route in the second quarter. Brisker made a couple of big hits throughout the night, though tight end Peyton Hendershot stiff-armed him in the open field late in the game. Penn State came up just short against Iowa last weekend, but Brisker played well. He started strong by attacking a run behind the line of scrimmage and intercepting a tipped pass in the first quarter. Brisker left the game briefly with a shoulder injury but returned quickly to stop a third-down quick pass late in the first half. He played a lot of deep coverage later in the game, breaking up a floating throw to the left sideline from a single-high look. Previous rank: No. 7 Johnson had only one sack in FSU's victories over the past two weeks, but his impact on passing downs was much greater than that number indicates. Johnson took away bootleg plays in both games, showing his awareness and agility on the edge. Against the run, he continues to use his bulk to keep contain on outside runs and takes on pulling guards coming his direction so others can make the play. Most importantly, he's a leader on the field and has shown durability by playing nearly twice as many snaps in six weeks as he did at Georgia in seven games last season. Officials flagged him for a personal foul penalty for illegal use of hands to the face in the North Carolina game, though it appeared he made contact with the left tackle's jersey, not his facemask, with his long-arm move on the play. Previous rank: No. 8 Auburn's secondary started off poorly against LSU in Week 5, with a blown coverage allowing star receiver Kayshon Boutte to run for a 55-yard gain on the first play. McCreary and the Tigers settled down after that drive, keeping Boutte to smaller gains throughout the final three quarters of Auburn's 24-19 win. The senior corner displayed the footwork and speed to stay with Boutte and other receivers all over the field, at times taking away Tigers quarterback Max Johnson's first look. McCreary's biggest play came in the second quarter, when he knocked a would-be touchdown pass out of WR Deion Smith's hands. LSU had to settle for a short field goal a few plays later. Georgia stayed away from McCreary last week. He did go up against 6-foot-7 tight end Darnell Washington late in the first quarter, drawing a questionable pass interference penalty after competing for the sideline pass. McCreary was credited with a pass breakup at the start of the fourth quarter after coming off his man to prevent running back James Cook from making a catch near the goal line on third down. He also took on Bulldogs running back Zamir White in the hole on the next series, and McCreary was no worse for the wear. Previous rank: No. 9 Kirkland played strong against Oregon State in Week 5, keeping his base wide and low in pass protection while attacking linemen in the run game. He was walking around a bit gingerly in the second half but only sat out a little while, returning to crash the left side so running back Sean McGrew could score a go-ahead touchdown. The Huskies' defense gave up 10 more points, though, leading to a 27-24 loss. Kirkland and his teammates had a bye last weekend while preparing for a tough slate the next five weeks (hosting UCLA, traveling to Arizona and Stanford, then coming back home to face Oregon and Arizona State). Previous rank: No. 5 Georgia didn't need Davis to make many plays in its 37-0 blowout of Arkansas two weeks ago. He ate up double-teams, freeing up other linemen to make plays. Davis slanted into one run late in the first half, dragging down the back after a short gain, and twice shed blocks at the line to stop quarterback K.J. Jefferson from scrambling for yardage. Davis had three tackles in the first quarter of the team's 34-10 win over Auburn last week, as the Tigers tried to establish a running game while the game was close. He showed he could stay low despite his height later in the game, creating a pile inside against a quarterback sneak so his teammates could make the stop. Previous rank: No. 6 Kentucky beat Florida in Lexington for the first time since 1986, with Kinnard leading the way on two scores. He got a hand on a second-level defender to free up receiver Wan'Dale Robinson in the first half, and then created space for Chris Rodriguez Jr.'s touchdown run in the fourth quarter. Kinnard didn't budge on bull rushes from Zachary Carter. Jeremiah Moon and Brenton Cox challenged him with speed and strong hands, but Kinnard kept them out of plays, too. He started the team's win over LSU last week, dominating defensive ends and linebackers with heavy hands and surprising short-area agility. A first-half leg injury showed him up a bit, but he worked through any pain to crash the edge on runs and maintain his balance in pass protection. Kinnard twice walled off two defenders on rushing attempts during the game-sealing touchdown drive. Previous rank: No. 4 Anderson often falls into the background because there are so many playmakers on Georgia's defense. His get-off, length and bend off the edge were evident, though, when shedding a tight end block to help Nakobe Dean drag down Arkansas QB J.K. Jefferson for a short loss late in the first quarter in Week 5. Anderson used a long-arm rush move in the first half to get the right tackle off-balance, but the play was cut short thanks to one of four false start penalties against Arkansas. He dropped into coverage and spied Jefferson later in the game, but finally recorded a sack in the fourth quarter as he shed the right tackle block to grab backup QB Malik Hornsby as he tried to escape the pocket. In last week's win over Auburn, Anderson again dropped into coverage regularly and played the run adeptly while splitting reps with Nolan Smith. Anderson beat the Tigers' right tackle with a quick inside move to bring down a running back for a short gain in the second quarter. He nearly had a sack late in the first half when moving quickly upfield then swiping away the left tackle inside, but the helping left guard just got enough of him to prevent the play. Previous rank: No. 3 Olave was glad to see quarterback C.J. Stroud return from a one-week absence for routs of Rutgers and Maryland; the starting passer found him 12 times for 239 yards and four TDs. A first-quarter catch against the Scarlet Knights was fit for highlight reels, as he jumped high into the air to snag a pass yet managed to get one foot in bounds. Olave worked inside and outside in both matchups, getting off the line smoothly and quickly to challenge man and zone coverages. He scored on a scramble drill and post-corner route in the red zone against Rutgers and on a post (with help from an over-aggressive safety) for his first score against Maryland. The senior Buckeye made an impressive catch for his third-quarter touchdown versus the Terps, fighting through contact and snatching a ball up for grabs in the middle of the end zone. He had a couple other chances for touchdowns in that contest but came up just short on a full-extension dive and had another ball tipped away by a safety at the last second. Olave surpassed Cris Carter for third on Ohio State's career receiving touchdown list last week with 29. He now trails Devin Smith (30) and David Boston (34). Previous rank: No. 2 Hutchinson made just three tackles in the Wolverines' 38-17 win over Wisconsin two weeks ago, but his presence was felt throughout the contest. He forced a holding call early (which was declined as a teammate got a sack on the play) and regularly took on blockers to take space away from running backs. Wisconsin tried twice to cross-block Hutchinson with guards, but he blew by them only to come up just short of the sack. He again spent much of his time in the backfield in Michigan's 32-29 win over Nebraska last week. Hutchinson beat the Huskers' tackles with power and swim moves, but quarterback Adrian Martinez was able to slip out of Hutchinson's grasp every time as the defender didn't quite have the agility and bend to grab him. In both games, Hutchinson's awareness and tenacity on the edge often pushed ball-carriers to other defenders so they could make the play. Previous rank: No. 1 UAB picked the wrong opponent for the opening of their new digs. Willis ran all over Protective Stadium two weeks ago (144 yards, two scores) in the 36-12 Liberty win, evading rushers in the backfield and powering through arm tackles on called draws. He didn't turn the ball over against the Blazers, but had three interceptions against Middle Tennessee last weekend. Willis twice tried to fit passes into tight windows and underthrew a deep pass on the third pick. But he also exhibited his potential against the Blue Raiders, showing a quick release and tight spiral on short and intermediate passes. He ghosted multiple pass rushers on one TD throw, ran for tough yardage (80 yards, one TD) and uncorked a 49-yard completion while moving to his left within the pocket.

2021 at 11:10 PM", "body": "NFL Media Reporter HENDERSON, Nev. -- Jon Gruden's resignation as Raiders coach Monday over toxic emails didn't just leave a stench behind -- it also left collateral damage that was hard for general manager Mike Mayock to explain Wednesday, and perhaps even harder for some people with the team to stomach. \"Every player that I've talked to, the reaction has been, 'Look, we're all in. We've been all in,' \" Mayock said candidly in a news conference, days after The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times reported Gruden used racist, misogynistic and homophobic language in a series of emails sent to Bruce Allen over several years, when Allen was an executive with the Washington Football Team. \"What I said to the players this morning is that there's a spectrum of opinions out there about Jon Gruden, from total condemnation to full empathy, OK, and everything in between.\" Raiders defensive end Carl Nassib, who came out as the NFL's first openly gay active player this summer, asked for and received a day off to process things, Mayock said. Though Mayock didn't explicitly say Nassib's request dealt with the report of Gruden's homophobic language, the GM did say the team would offer any support players may need to get through this. \"He's pretty much a lone wolf when it comes to that,\" tight end Darren Waller said of Nassib. \"Nobody should be able to tell him how to feel. ... I can't imagine what he must be feeling.\" Waller said that he was disappointed by the email in which, per a Friday report by The Wall Street Journal, Gruden said NFL Players Association executive director DeMaurice Smith had \"lips the size of michellin (sic) tires.\" Waller said he felt the racist undertones of that email. He was also thinking of ways to offer Gruden \"grace,\" and that he tried to understand Gruden's explanation. Ultimately, though, he and the team had to quickly turn their attention to their upcoming contest against the Bears, what ended up being a Week 5 defeat in which they looked flat and lost. \"It's just a lot to process,\" Waller said. While much of the focus Wednesday was on how the team, players and coaches would re-direct for the rest of the season, there is more to wrestle with when it comes to the Raiders and the people who work for this organization, which was built on standards of inclusion, diversity and equality that the NFL as a whole has yet to catch up on. Owner Mark Davis is beyond hurt by what Gruden -- who signed a 10-year, $100 million contract in 2018 -- said in the emails, according to multiple employees. Davis and others in the organization are also unhappy that, as they see it, they are bearing the brunt of a scandal that began with the NFL's investigation into allegations of workplace misconduct and sexual harassment within the Washington Football Team. Yes, Davis hired Gruden to coach the Raiders, but some within the organization question why, of the 650,000 emails in total that were part of the investigation, Gruden's were the only ones to be leaked. And why were those emails, sent to Allen over a seven-year period before Gruden began his most recent stint with the team, leaked now? Beyond those questions, there is so much to get over and get through. \"A lot of emotions, obviously,\" quarterback Derek Carr said. \"Didn't see all of this coming. I don't think any of us did. It caught us all by surprise. ... From an emotional standpoint, I got a job to do ... no matter who the coach is.\" The coach in question is former special teams coordinator Rich Bisaccia, whose dream opportunity as the interim leader of the Raiders comes amid one of the biggest recent controversies in sports, with a team that dropped to within one game of .500 after losing two straight. \"The mood is good,\" Bisaccia said after coaching his first practice in his new role. \"My concern or my conversation with them would be, what's it going to be five days from now? What's it going to be a week from now? Players are resilient. They've gone through a tough time. We all have.\" Bisaccia, who said earlier in his news conference that he is \"still a friend of Coach Gruden's,\" said \"no one wants to be a head coach in this particular situation, no one wants to be put in front of this under these particular circumstances. But it's an incredible opportunity, certainly, not only for me but all the other coaches that are here to see what we can do with this adversity, see what we can do with this challenge ... and the same thing for our players.\" The reviews on Bisaccia's lengthy body of work as a coaching assistant (he's in his 20th NFL season and fourth with the Raiders) have been positive. Moreover, he is known as a top-quality person with no personal agendas. Example 1A seemed to come on his first day as the head coach. He opened practice working with kickers and punters, as usual. That must have shown players Bisaccia's ego did not grow with this unforeseen opportunity. As Mayock and others pointed out, this is uncharted turf. Most in-season coaching changes take place when a team has sunk into top-five draft position and there are three or four games remaining. The Raiders, on the other hand, have a big game at Denver, with whom they are tied for second in the AFC West, on Sunday. The majority of Las Vegas' season remains ahead. The team can still earn a playoff berth and a write script of perseverance -- or come undone after the unimaginable downfall of their former head coach. \"I hate to make this sound brusque in any way, but I know the human-interest element here,\" Mayock said. \"I understand all the concerns from all the different constituencies. I get it. But at the end of the day, our jobs are to win football games, and we've got to get our focus back there. And that might sound cold and it might sound calculating, but at the end of the day, that's our job.\" Follow Steve Wyche on Twitter.

Can Jalen Hurts match Tom Brady?", "author": "Marc Sessler", "date": "Oct 13, 2021 at 08:23 AM", "body": "Around the NFL Writer Itching to watch an underdog try to overcome the odds or triumph against adversity? Simply looking to pass the time reading another NFL.com article while stuck in your cube? Marc Sessler offers a bead on six us-against-the-world scenarios to track entering Week 6: We entered this season assuming Washington's defense was stout -- perhaps even Super Bowl-caliber. Instead, the unit has operated as a welcome friend to opposing attacks by allowing a whopping 31 points per game, more than every team league-wide beyond Sunday's opponent: defense-averse Kansas City. That bodes well for a ï»¿Taylor Heinickeï»¿-led offense charged with pacing ï»¿Patrick Mahomesï»¿, but what about Washington's flimsy wall? The pass rush appeared in a 33-22 loss to the Saints, but so did the defense's knack for blown coverages. Safety ï»¿Landon Collinsï»¿ was caught playing catch-up on Jameis Winston's 72-yard scoring bomb to a wide-open Deonte Harris. Asked about the gaffe, Washington coach Ron Rivera told reporters a defender should have been stationed deep. Even more ghastly was Marquez Callaway's 49-yard Hail Mary score before the half, an edgy play call that caught The Team with its pants down -- a gaggle of burgundy-clad men who appeared in a state of frozen admiration at Winston's gorgeous hurl. \"We [weren't] expecting them to go Hail Mary there. A regular football team will try to get a couple yards and kick a field goal,\" said veteran corner William Jackson III, who inked a three-year, $40.5 million deal this past March to play both regular and irregular opponents. Communication issues have beguiled a defense that gave up 29 points to the G-Men, 30 to Atlanta and 43 to the Bills. Kansas City coach Andy Reid sees what we see: The Chiefs must win shootouts. They're hampered by bottom-five run and pass defenses, and tied for the fifth-fewest takeaways in the NFL. It's a chance for Heinicke to peak, but does anyone trust Washington to solve ï»¿Travis Kelceï»¿ and ï»¿Tyreek Hillï»¿, a two-headed, LSD-doused Rubik's Cube determined to beguile coordinators weekly? Call it his messiest start of the year, but ï»¿Jalen Hurtsï»¿ took a step forward in Sunday's nail-biter win at Carolina. For two-plus quarters, Hurts and the Eagles were out of sorts against the Panthers, squeezing out 13 yards over their first seven drives. Philadelphia's chances drifted when Hurts overthrew a third-quarter lob that landed in the arms of underrated Panthers cover man Donte Jackson. Instead of folding, though, the young starter overcame his mistake with artistry: a laser to ï»¿Dallas Goedertï»¿ that set up Hurts' second rushing score. He then sealed the 21-18 win by evading Carolina heat-seeker ï»¿Haason Reddickï»¿ to rip a two-point dart to ï»¿DeVonta Smithï»¿ in the back of the end zone. Said tackle ï»¿Jordan Mailataï»¿ of Hurts: \"He's all bite, no bark.\" This resilience will be requisite against Tampa on Thursday night. The Eagles were flamed for 83 godless points in back-to-back losses to Dallas and Kansas City. Tom Brady's Bucs have posted 45-plus in two of their past four tilts. We barely blinked Sunday as a 44-year-old man posted season highs in passing yards (411), rating (144.4) and air scores (5) against a previously feared Miami defense. There's a sense the Eagles -- lounging in a stream of accrued high draft picks -- remain in referendum mode on Hurts. I see a starter who offers nearly everything you could ask for in today's environment. Tampa Bay's defense will limit Hurts on the ground, but the Bucs have allowed 275-plus passing yards and two-plus air scores to every quarterback they've faced. With Philly hosting Tampa on the nationally televised TNF stage, here's an opportunity for Hurts to further establish himself as a fantasy -- and real-life -- stud. Two weeks ago, they were the feel-good venture of the year: A frolicking, fun-loving, DGAF Raiders squad having their way in the Vegas heat. Today, they've dropped back-to-back stinkfests against the Chargers and Bears -- and that was before their head coach suddenly resigned during Monday Night Football. Jon Gruden's shocking exodus -- following reports that emails he authored over a seven-year span included racist, homophobic and misogynistic language -- alters the very core composition of a Raiders squad dipped for years in his Chucky-fueled aura and unflinching offensive philosophy. Where to now? Can special teams coordinator turned interim coach Rich Bisaccia prevent a total team implosion? Beyond the organizational shockwaves, there's plenty to fix on the field before traveling to Denver for Sunday's tussle with the Broncos. After averaging 401 passing yards over his first three starts, Derek Carr has screamed back to earth behind a line that's given up seven sacks over the past two weeks. Carr's definitely not my favorite quarterback to observe, but the polarizing signal-caller is not to blame: In Sunday's loss to Chicago, injuries forced rookie tackle ï»¿Alex Leatherwoodï»¿ to play right guard while little-used Brandon Parker filled in at OT. Upshot: The NFL's second-most penalized team fizzled on the ground while birthing a ridiculous eight holding infractions. It's one reason the Raiders have hit double-digit deficits in four of five first halves. These feel like nerdy details inside a whirlwind week for Las Vegas. With the season on the brink, though, maybe it's time for the Raiders to lean into their true identity: a devil-may-care, deep-ball stage act throwing balance to the wind. The Silver and Black vs. The World. Plopped on a couch during the NFL's longest-ever Sunday, I found myself openly rooting for Houston to complete the upset against Bill Belichick. The Patriots -- scoring 16 unanswered points -- wouldn't allow it in a 25-22 win, but New England was beyond permissible with Davis Mills. Houston's thrust-into-the-fire rookie passer overcame Week 4's brutal four-pick meltdown in Buffalo to sock the Patriots where it counts. Completing nearly 73 percent of his throws, Mills uncorked two deep-shot scores and didn't turn the ball over. The third-rounder was money when it mattered, hitting 12 of 13 throws for 209 yards and two touchdowns on third and fourth downs. Our friends in the desert view the Texans as sitting ducks against the Colts, but not if we get last Sunday's version of Mills. If his ascent continues (and if someone burns that Buffalo tape), why not get a longer look instead of throwing ï»¿Tyrod Taylorï»¿ back into a largely meaningless campaign? Back to the Patriots. Belichick's defenses have spent 20-plus years chomping rookie passers to bits. Mills, though -- surrounded by skill players presumed to be a flock of naÃ¯fs -- pumped out the highest rookie passer rating ever against Bill's Pats, per NFL Research. Mills went into halftime having completed 12 of 16 throws for 202 yards. It was the kind of slump you don't expect from a Belichick-run defense -- not against a Texans team that had scored just nine total points over its previous two games. A glitch in the sim? Or have we finally reached that off-in-the-distance, shimmering vista where the Patriots are just another team? Staying afloat with wins over the Texans and Jets amid frustrating stumbles against Miami, New Orleans and Tampa. The next five weeks include showdowns with the Cowboys, Chargers, Panthers and Browns. In a post-Brady milieu, the Patriots feel like a stretch in every one of those clashes. Welcome to average. When the league added a 17th regular-season game last spring, Cleveland appeared to draw the easiest assignment out of the rugged NFC West: the Cardinals. Little did society know that Arizona would morph into the NFL's last remaining undefeated team led by a bona fide MVP candidate in Kyler Murrayï»¿. The Browns are technically favored in Sunday's tilt, but that's a total charade if they don't get healthier. In Week 5's 47-42 loss to the Chargers, Cleveland toiled through injuries at both offensive tackle spots. In the secondary, my 12-year-old niece, Irene Manchester, finished the game at slot corner after Denzel Wardï»¿, Greedy Williamsï»¿, Troy Hill and M.J. Stewart all left for portions of Sunday. Jadeveon Clowney is nicked up, too. It's a scenario to monitor, as Murray rolls into town with DeAndre Hopkins, Christian Kirk, electric rookie Rondale Moore and a revived A.J. Green looking to fry a hobbled secondary. Follow Marc Sessler on Twitter. In this edition of the Scout's Notebook, Bucky Brooks identifies four sneaky playoff contenders.

"author": "Dan Hanzus", "date": "Oct 12, 2021 at 08:08 AM", "body": "Around the NFL Writer The Bills announced themselves as the team to beat in the AFC on Sunday night. A near-perfect performance at Arrowhead was enough to vault the Orchard Park heroes to the top of the Power Rankings. Close behind them are Cowboys and Chargers teams that crash the top five for the first time this season. Meanwhile, the stunning downfall of Jon Gruden has resulted in a free-fall for the Raiders. Everything can change in an instant in the NFL. This past week is a reminder. Let's get to it. Watch the NFL Power Rankings show with Dan and Matt \"Money\" Smith every Tuesday at 3 p.m. ET on NFL Network. NOTE: Up/down arrows reflect movement from the Week 5 Power Rankings. Previous rank: No. 3  Defeating the Chiefs in October and defeating them in January are two very different beasts, but that doesn't mean Sunday night's 38-20 stomping of the defending conference champs wasn't important. For the Bills, it was affirmation of what they already believed: With superstar quarterback Josh Allen out front, they can beat anyone. They might even embarrass you. That's what happened at Arrowhead Stadium, where Patrick Mahomes struggled to find any rhythm against a Buffalo defense that played like it knew what was coming. Bills defenders might tell you they did, which is a credit to Sean McDermott and his entire coaching staff. Buffalo is a juggernaut. Previous rank: No. 1  Kyler Murray, Kliff Kingsbury and the offense get much of the headlines coming out of Arizona, but it was the Cardinals' defense that took the NFC West leaders to 5-0. The Cards held Trey Lance to 10 points in his NFL starting debut and stopped the 49ers on four of their five fourth-down attempts in a 17-10 win. The most dramatic of those stuffs came in the second quarter, when Lance scrambled toward the right pylon before slamming into a wall comprised of brick (Tanner Vallejo) and mortar (Isaiah Simmons). After the game, DeAndre Hopkins called it \"championship football.\" Lance would probably describe it a different way. Previous rank: No. 2  The weirdest stat of Week 5: Sunday's 45-17 win over the Dolphins marked the first time Tom Brady threw for more than 400 yards and five touchdowns in a game. This feels impossible, given Brady's unmatched rÃ©sumÃ© over 22 seasons, but it's true. Not bad production, considering Brady didn't even play the final nine minutes of regulation as Blaine Gabbert closed out an overmatched Miami team. At halftime, newly acquired veteran cornerback Richard Sherman approached teammate Leonard Fournette and shared the eye-opening opinion that he'd never been part of a team with so much talent. The running back's response? \"This s***'s different.\" Previous rank: No. 6  The Cowboys swept their three-game homestand against the Eagles, Panthers and Giants by a combined score of 121-69 -- a stretch of dominance that cements America's Team as a force to be reckoned with in the NFC. On Sunday, the Cowboys rolled up 515 yards of total offense on a bruised-and-battered Giants team that -- like the Eagles and Washington -- knows the best-case scenario is scrambling for a wild-card spot come December. If Dallas keeps its health, the NFC East race is already over. The next question: How good can the Cowboys be? As we approach mid-October, they cut the profile of a legitimate Super Bowl contender. Previous rank: No. 7ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿  Justin Herbert Is A Savage In The Pocket. The second-year prodigy was an unstoppable force against the Browns, throwing for 398 yards with five total scores in a 47-42 win at Hollywood Park. The Bolts' usually reliable defense stumbled through its worst performance of the season, but Herbert was there to pick up the slack with his cadre of playmakers. L.A.'s 26 points in the final period were the most by a team in a fourth quarter in eight years. \"To win a game like this that turns into a track meet, you have to have a superstar quarterback,\" coach Brandon Staley said after the victory. \"And that's what he is.\" You know what else he is? (Please see first sentence.) Previous rank: No. 4  The Packers love Mason Crosby. He's been a dependable contributor for years, and he's always weathered the storms of inconsistency that grip all kickers not named Justin Tucker. After Crosby missed his third field goal in less than an hour on Sunday against the Bengals, Matt LaFleur decided to check in on his grizzled veteran. \"I could see the look in his eyes,\" the coach said. \"There was zero flinch from him.\" Given one more shot to salvage his afternoon, Crosby split the uprights to lift the Packers to an overtime conquest over the Bengals, the team's fourth consecutive win. \"I went up to him and just told him I loved him,\" running back Aaron Jones said after the win. \"You'll always stay with your teammates no matter what.\" Previous rank: No. 5   Lamar Jackson reminded the world on Monday night that he is one of one. The Ravens' quarterback authored the greatest passing game of his career, carving up the Colts for 442 yards and four touchdowns in a ridiculous comeback win. The Ravens fell behind 22-3 early and were trailing by 16 points in the fourth quarter before ripping off the final 22 points of the game. The comeback included two Mark Andrews touchdowns and, ridiculously, two Mark Andrews two-point conversions. When the Ravens won the overtime coin toss, the game was already over. Jackson marched Baltimore through an exhausted Indy defense for 68 yards on 10 plays, ending with the Hollywood Brown game-winner. It was a brilliant comeback that just might have been Jackson's best performance yet. Previous rank: No. 9  Welcome back to the offense, Robert Woods. The veteran wide receiver is one of the Rams' top weapons, but forming a connection with Matthew Stafford was more difficult than expected in the season's first four weeks. That changed against the Seahawks on Thursday night, when Woods turned a whopping 14 targets into 12 catches for 150 yards in a 26-17 win over their division rivals. The Los Angeles passing attack is imposing when Cooper Kupp, DeSean Jackson and Tyler Higbee are on the field at the same. Add Woods' reliable presence into the mix, and it can be overwhelming. Previous rank: No. 10   In wins over the Bears and Vikings, the Browns authored two of the most dominant defensive performances we've seen by any team all season. On Sunday, Cleveland's D entered The Twilight Zone. Kevin Stefanski's team surrendered 493 total yards -- and 26 points in the fourth quarter alone -- in a 47-42 insta-classic loss to the Chargers. Disappointing outcome aside, the Browns' beat-up defense should recover, while a huge bounce-back performance from Baker Mayfield and the offense offered promise of better days. If these Browns can put both sides of their game plan together, they'll be tough to stop. Previous rank: No. 8  Following a humbling blowout loss at home on Sunday Night Football, you can imagine the Chiefs wondering aloud -- to borrow a Madden-ism -- where that truck came from. The 18-wheeler in question was Josh Allen, Micah Hyde and the rest of a Buffalo Bills team that put Kansas City on notice: You may be the back-to-back defending conference champion, but you're not the best team in the AFC. The truth is, it's not close right now. The Chiefs have been mistake-prone on offense and overmatched on defense, facts the Bills laid bare. \"You kind of have to take it on the chin,\" Patrick Mahomes said. \"We've still got a long season left, but this one you're going to remember.\" Previous rank: No. 19  The Saints might be the NFL's most perplexing team through five weeks, but a surge of reinforcements could bring some more clarity (and consistency) to Sean Payton's squad. Wide receivers Michael Thomas and Tre'Quan Smith, kicker Wil Lutz, left tackle Terron Armstead and center Erik McCoy are all eligible to return to action following the Week 6 bye. Defensive tackle David Onyemata is eligible to return from suspension following Week 7's matchup against the Seahawks. That's a long list of valuable players, and it's a credit to these Saints that they managed to get to their well-timed bye above .500. No team can survive in the NFL without roster depth. The 2021 Saints just proved they have it. Previous rank: No. 18  The Big Dog is still The Big Dog. Any attempts to fade The Big Dog will result in the stern reminder that The Big Dog is not to be disrespected under any circumstances. Derrick Henry rushed for 159 yards and three touchdowns, another mighty performance in a 37-19 win over the lowly Jaguars. Henry is on pace to set the NFL record for carries and rushing yards this season, and it's hard to imagine an otherwise ordinary Titans team turning away from the one thing that makes it special. This stat, from CBS: Henry just completed the most productive 40-game stretch by a running back in NFL history. His 4,792 yards over the span is just ahead of Jim Brown (4,759). Jim Brown. Previous rank: No. 15  Evan McPherson's NFL career is off to a promising start, but he'll have to do some special things to escape being remembered as The Kicker Who Celebrated Too Soon. The rookie's overtime field-goal attempt against the Packers started straight before veering left and making contact with the flapping orange flag blowing atop the left upright. McPherson thought he'd converted his third game-winning kick in five professional contests, but instead it was a miss that set up an eventual 25-22 loss. McPherson later said he thought the officials were \"playing a game\" with him. That would have been a pretty mean-spirited prank, to be honest. Previous rank: No. 14  Christian McCaffrey returned to practice last week -- now the Panthers need their superstar RB back on Sundays. The Carolina offense sputtered again in a frustrating loss to the Eagles that featured three Sam Darnold interceptions and pass-protection issues that we didn't see before No. 22 exited with a hamstring injury in Week 3. Such is the importance of McCaffrey, a driving force in both the running and passing games. He seems especially essential to Darnold, whose turnover-prone ways have returned without his safety valve sliding out of the backfield. \"Sam needs to take what's given him,\" Matt Rhule said. \"If we do that, we'll get back on track quickly.\" Previous rank: No. 17  No Dalvin Cook? No problem! That was the general sentiment -- perhaps not behind the scenes at Vikings headquarters -- but around the team as it prepared for the winless Lions on Sunday. Naturally, Minnesota found itself in a street fight against Dan Campbell's scrappy group, which pushed the Vikings to the brink before the kicker saved the day. Greg Joseph hit four of five kicks, including the 54-yarder as time expired in a 19-17 win over Detroit. It was a redemptive moment for Joseph, whose miss from 37 yards out cost the Vikings a win over the Cardinals in Week 2. Still, concerns linger over an offense that looked all but unstoppable in the season's first three weeks. Is it a simple slump, or a sign of bigger issues? Previous rank: No. 20  ï»¿ï»¿Progress. The Steelers desperately needed to show signs of it on offense in Week 5, and that's exactly what they did. Ben Roethlisberger threw for 253 yards and two scores, and Najee Harris produced like the first-round pick he is in a 27-19 win over the Broncos. It wasn't all good news for the offense, however: JuJu Smith-Schuster's season is over after he suffered a shoulder injury that will require surgery. Pittsburgh has a good group of playmakers at wide receiver, but Smith-Schuster was a treasured safety valve in the slot for a veteran quarterback who loves to get the ball out quickly when the pass rush closes in (and even when it doesn't). Previous rank: No. 13  Trey Lance brought some much-appreciated excitement to the offense in his first career start. Points? That was a different story. Lance threw one interception and the Niners were stuffed on four of their five attempts on fourth down, the difference in a 17-10 loss to the undefeated Cardinals. Lance looked very much like a raw rookie at times on Sunday, but he also moved San Francisco into Arizona territory on eight occasions and led the team with 89 rushing yards. It felt like something to build off of, but Kyle Shanahan appears determined to turn back to Jimmy Garoppolo if the veteran is ready to return from a calf injury after the Week 6 bye, and Lance is now dealing with a knee sprain that that will be re-evaluated at the end of the week. Previous rank: No. 11  In 2018, the Raiders gave Jon Gruden a 10-year, $100 million contract with the hope he would guide the franchise back to the promised land. Instead, Gruden resigned on Monday after three seasons and five games following reports that emails he wrote over a seven-year span included racist, misogynistic and homophobic comments. Gruden's sudden downfall is one of the biggest bombshells in franchise history. More than just the head coach, Gruden was the face of the franchise and driving architect behind the team's construction. Interim coach Rich Bisaccia has been tasked with keeping the 2021 season from slipping away under extraordinary circumstances. As for who fills the massive power vacuum in Vegas? The Raiders are probably asking themselves the same question. Previous rank: No. 16  ï»¿ï»¿Inefficiency in the red zone plagued Teddy Bridgewater during his one season with the Panthers. You could make the case that Bridgewater, not Sam Darnold, would still be Matt Rhule's QB in Charlotte had he not made so many backbreaking mistakes near the goal line. Fast-forward to the present day, and Bridgewater has brought this problem to Denver. Facing an eight-point deficit in the final minute on Sunday, the Broncos failed in four cracks from inside the Pittsburgh 10. The final play was the clincher, a poorly thrown ball picked off by the Steelers with 11 seconds to play. In these crucible moments, Teddy simply needs to be better. Previous rank: No. 25ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿  ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿The Eagles were in desperate need of a big play late in Sunday's matchup against the Panthers. They got one in each phase of the game during the final five minutes of a 21-18 win. T.J. Edwards' blocked punt, Jalen Hurts' 6-yard touchdown run and a Steven Nelson interception of Sam Darnold turned a five-point deficit into a three-point victory that snapped a three-game losing streak. Next up for the Eagles is a huge measuring-stick game against the reigning champion Bucs on Thursday night. It will take more than a strong finish to beat Tampa Bay. Previous rank: No. 12  ï»¿The Good Ship Carroll is taking on water. The Seahawks fell to 2-3 with a home loss to the division-rival Rams, then learned that Russell Wilson could miss at least a few games after undergoing surgery on the finger he injured in Thursday's game at Lumen Field. The Seahawks are a team searching for an identity: Pete Carroll loves to run the football and ride with his defense, but the rushing attack is average and the defense is in the conversation for the league's worst. Wilson is the one who has always held it together -- take Seattle's superstar quarterback out of the mix and there's nothing left to hold onto. Previous rank: No. 22  ï»¿Generally speaking, a scenario that combines a rookie QB making his fifth start and an offensive line missing four starters is -- well -- not ideal. It's the stuff blowout losses are made of, and perhaps that would have been the Patriots' fate had they not been playing the hapless Texans on Sunday. But perhaps not, considering Mac Jones is showing us on a weekly basis that he's not your typical rookie quarterback. Jones engineered a pair of fourth-quarter scoring marches on Sunday, including his first classified as a game-winning drive, in a 25-22 win. Jones isn't as flashy as the other rookie QBs, but on balance, he's been the most impressive. ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿Previous rank: No. 29  The identity of the Justin Fields Bears -- in 2021, anyway -- is beginning to take shape. Run the football (a lot), ask your young QB to protect the football and make a few plays, then let the defense take it home. That was a formula for success against the Raiders in a convincing 20-9 win at Allegiant Stadium. Chicago proved it could move the ball on the ground even without David Montgomery (knee), getting a combined 139 yards on 34 rushes from Damien Williams and Khalil Herbert. Will the Bearsâ formula work against the NFLâs elite? Imposing tests lie ahead with the Packers and Bucs up next. Previous rank: No. 21  As the Ravens celebrated their stunning overtime win over the Colts, ESPN cut to a replay of Carson Wentz on the sideline reacting to the game-winning touchdown by Marquise \"Hollywood\" Brown moments earlier. Wentz anxiously rubbed his hand through his hair, clearly stunned by what had just transpired. A 25-9 fourth-quarter lead had turned into a 31-25 defeat. The biggest win of the season had morphed grotesquely into one of the most crushing defeats in recent franchise history. A collapse like this has many fathers: There were multiple breakdowns on special teams, while a gassed defense offered zero resistance against a rampaging Lamar Jackson. It was a game the Colts absolutely could not lose ... and yet, they did.  Previous rank: No. 27ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿  The Falcons flew high over London thanks to a vintage performance by Matt Ryan. The veteran signal-caller might not be able to sling the ball like he did five years ago, but he showed against the Jets that he can still pick apart a young and inexperienced defense with surgical precision. It helps to have a stud like Kyle Pitts around. With Calvin Ridley out, the No. 4 overall pick finally enjoyed the breakout game many had been waiting for; Pitts went off, hauling in nine catches for 119 yards and his first career touchdown against a New York defense ill-equipped to handle his rare combination of size and speed. Pittsâ special skill set deserves a Darren Waller-level target share. Previous rank: No. 23  Is there a more disappointing defense in football than Washington's this year? Ron Riveraâs D made progress in pass-rushing and takeaways against the Saints, but the inability to stop big plays continued to haunt the Football Team in a 33-22 loss. On Sunday, Washington allowed a 72-yard touchdown to Deonte Harris and a Hail Mary score to Marquez Callaway at the end of the first half. After the game, Washington players said they didnât see the end zone heave coming, which, hoo boy. Said Rivera: âIâm very frustrated, because we have too many good football players to not be better than what we are right now.â Previous rank: No. 24  Week 5 was a disaster for the Giants. Daniel Jones (concussion), Saquon Barkley (ankle) and Kenny Golladay (knee) were all lost to injury as the superior Cowboys coasted to a 44-20 win at Jerrah World. It was a sobering game for Big Blue, which entered Sunday feeling great about a season turnaround after a big comeback win in New Orleans. Now begins a week of health updates: Barkley and Golladay are expected to miss Week 6, while Jones needs to clear the leagueâs concussion protocol. Rookie Kadarius Toney, who had a breakout game on Sunday (10 catches, 189 yards) before getting ejected for throwing a punch, is also banged up (lower leg), but his ailment doesn't sound too significant. With a brutal schedule ahead, Joe Judgeâs team is in serious danger of second-half irrelevance. Previous rank: No. 26ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿  The Dolphins will get on the plane to London wondering what they are: A good team in a bad slump or a bad team in a long season. Facing the Bucs' gang of All-Pros and future Hall of Famers presents a tough assignment for anyone, but Sunday's 45-17 loss to the defending champions wasnât the type of performance to engender hope that a turnaround is near. Miami allowed 558 yards of total offense, including 411 passing yards and five touchdowns to Tom Brady, the legendary quarterback who is still finding ways to torture the Dolphins fan base from the beyond the AFC East grave. Previous rank: No. 31  Dan Campbell isnât one to hide his emotions, so it wasnât a surprise when the Lions coach got emotional after his teamâs latest heartbreaking loss. Detroit is 0-5, with two of its defeats coming on last-second field-goals that bordered on the impossible. This one was made more painful because the Lions had orchestrated a stunning comeback to take a late lead over the Vikings. It still wasnât enough. \"You want it for yourself, as an organization and for all of us,â Campbell said with tears in his eyes. âBut you want it for those players. Theyâre out there busting their ass and â¦ itâs tough.â Previous rank: No. 32  Davis Mills shredded the Patriots' defense in the way many expected Tom Brady to a week earlier. The third-round rookie washed away the memory of his four-INT Week 4 performance, setting career highs in passing yards (312) and touchdown passes (3) in a narrow 25-22 loss. Davisâ productive day was especially impressive considering Bill Belichickâs typical mastery over rookie quarterbacks as New England's head coach: The Hooded One moved to 22-6 against first-year QBs, but this one wasnât a laugher like many of the others. The only Texan player seeing ghosts on this day was Ka'imi Fairbairn, who missed a field goal and two PATs. Kaânt do that. ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿Previous rank: No. 28  The Jets mysteriously lost their momentum somewhere over the Atlantic Ocean before landing in London, delivering a deeply lackluster performance in a 27-20 loss to the Falcons at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Robert Saleh hits the bye week with more holes to plug than fingers on his two hands: The defense is coming up empty in the gameâs most important moments, while rookie quarterback Zach Wilson is back to square one after another shaky showing. Saleh and offensive coordinator Mike LaFleur need to find ways to get Wilson more comfortable, especially early in games. One idea: Make a point to get highly drafted young playmakers like Elijah Moore and Denzel Mims involved. It shouldnât be this hard. Previous rank: No. 30ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿  The losses continue to pile up while Urban Meyer continues to give Shad Khan buyerâs remorse on a biblical scale. After another lopsided defeat, this time to the Titans, the Jaguars have lost 20 consecutive games. They havenât won since last yearâs season opener, and theyâre the first team to lose 20 in a row since 1977. That team, Tampa Bay, was an expansion franchise. Jacksonville hasnât been able to lean on that excuse for 26 years. \"You can't wrap your head around that,\" running back James Robinson said of The Streak. \"We've got to find a way to win.â Follow Dan Hanzus on Twitter.

"NFL trade deadline: An executive's guide to player transactions", "author": "Scott Pioli", "date": "Oct 13, 2021 at 11:47 AM", "body": "NFL Media Analyst Scott Pioli has decades of experience when it comes to building NFL teams. He made five trips to the Super Bowl as an executive, winning three championships as a member of the New England Patriots' front office. This background makes him the perfect teacher when it comes to significant NFL undertakings. In this educational series, presented via Q&A format, the five-time NFL Executive of the Year will shed light on hot topics and trends throughout the calendar year. With the 2021 NFL trade deadline nearing, Pioli addresses all things trades, including when discussions begin, who's involved and what's off limits. When is the 2021 NFL trade deadline? The 2021 trade deadline is set ahead of Week 9 at 4 p.m. ET on Tuesday, Nov. 2. When do trade discussions begin ahead of the trade deadline? Trade discussions, a key part of roster-building that I wrote about in August, happen year-round. They can even linger after the trade deadline -- discussions that went dormant over the latter portion of the regular season can pick up again in January or February, whether between the same teams, a new partner or with a partner who is now working for a new team. That said, once rosters have been constructed prior to Week 1, most teams are focused on the regular season. At most (if not all) of my stops as a general manager, we always listened to potential trade opportunities but didn't let ourselves get distracted from the task at hand. And while we believed in in-season player acquisitions, they tended to come through the waiver wire, not necessarily via trades. There aren't a ton of players made available for trades immediately after a season begins -- but this can change. Sometimes a player will be put on the market if a younger player ascends at his position (SEE: Marlon Mack, who could be headed elsewhere after being displaced by Jonathan Taylor in Indianapolis). Sometimes a player grows unhappy in his current situation. Sometimes a team will decide to capitalize on a closing window for other suitors to acquire a player for less compensation. The San Francisco 49ers' acquisition of Jimmy Garoppolo from the New England Patriots in October of 2017 is a perfect example of this. The 49ers jumped at the opportunity to snag the backup quarterback, who was set to hit free agency the following offseason, for a second-round draft pick rather than waiting until the offseason, when they might have had more competition from other teams. Garoppolo went 5-0 to finish that season, then signed an extension in February. The ever-changing dynamics within the NFL can increase or decrease trade value and speed up or slow discussions at any time. How do trade talks start in the NFL? In short, they can start anywhere people are talking about roster changes. In my experience, those conversations commonly take place between general managers, head coaches and agents. The only way a suitor can confirm a player is available is to check with the team that has the rights to the player. That team must give consent to engage in discussions by league rule and set the boundaries of those discussions. The most important language included in almost every contract is that the player being traded must report and pass the new club's physical in order for the transaction to be complete. One way to get trades done quickly is for a team to make it known that it is releasing a player a day or two before it actually submits the transaction to the league. This advertises that a player is available, essentially proclaiming, \"Come and get this player if you want him.\" Any player released during the season must go through waivers, and there is a specific claiming order for teams based on current records and standings. Bad teams get first dibs, so if a team with a good record knows it won't be able to claim a player via waivers, it will likely call the team and try to trade for him before the release is officially submitted to the league. Essentially, it's advertising that the team will take close to anything for a player that otherwise would net no returns if the player is just cut. Think of how news that the Patriots were going to release Stephon Gilmore preceded his trade to Carolina. When first considering trading a player, it's common to reach out to someone from another team with whom you have a preexisting relationship. Sometimes you want to dip your toe into the water to see how other organizations view a player's value, and reaching out to someone close to you usually ensures news of this inquiry won't leak. Then, if a trade doesn't happen, you don't have to deal with the fallout from the player or agent. Why do or don't NFL teams engage in in-season trades? Let's talk through several circumstances. Salary-cap issues can impact either side of a potential deal; after all, teams aren't just trading for players, they're also trading for their contracts. Although it didn't occur in-season, a perfect example of this is the Matthew Stafford-Jared Goff trade from last offseason, where the Lions and Rams had to ensure the money balanced out in addition to exchanging assets. Player holdouts also present unique and complicated situations. Deion Branch wanted a new contract in 2006, two seasons after he was named Super Bowl MVP with the Patriots, and he held out through training camp. We truly didn't want to trade him, but we couldn't agree to a contract that was comfortable for both the team and player. Plus, by the end of August, it was evident that our relationship was fractured. We were at a stalemate. Ultimately, we gave Branch permission to seek a trade, and we eventually traded him to the Seahawks in exchange for a first-round pick. Unknown circumstances around a player will often prevent a team from pursuing a player via trade -- i.e., Deshaun Watsonï»¿. The quarterback asked to be traded from the Houston Texans in January, but then 22 civil lawsuits were filed accusing him of sexual assault and harassment. There are ongoing investigations by the FBI, Houston Police and the NFL, and there have been no resolutions to date. And Watson remains on the Texans. It's presumably extremely difficult for teams to determine Watson's true value when his status is so uncertain. Generally speaking, teams prefer to receive something of value in return when moving bad contracts, but sometimes, just getting a contract off the books -- and thus lowering one's cap -- is worth making a deal, regardless of the compensation. Are NFL teams traditionally familiar with a player before they pursue him in a trade? Yes, but to varying degrees. The player might have a preexisting relationship with a coach or member of the personnel staff or another player on that team. Sometimes, a team will retain institutional knowledge about -- or maintain a crush on -- a player it wasn't able to draft. Think of the Minkah Fitzpatrick trade between the Miami Dolphins and Pittsburgh Steelers in September of 2019, early in Fitzpatrick's second pro season. A deteriorating relationship between Fitzpatrick and the Dolphins led to the team granting him permission to seek a trade, and the Steelers -- who clearly possessed relevant information on Fitzpatrick from old homework assignments during the draft process -- pounced on the opportunity to get him. Teams don't always have a preexisting relationship with a player they're pursuing, but those types of trades carry greater risk, because there generally is not enough time to do sufficient due diligence between when a player becomes available and when the player is traded. Teams sacrifice a lot of capital for great players, but at some point, there has to be a return for the investment. Is winning a division or getting to the playoffs enough? In fantasy football, people are sometimes wary of giving up too much for a player or get too attached to players. Does this happen in real life? Sure it does, but NFL decision-makers are paid to do what is best for the team and the greater good of everyone involved -- the owner, coaches, players, personnel department and the fan base. There is an obligation to everyone working in the organization to make roster moves and decisions that you believe are in the best interests of the organization, in the short- and long-term, so everyone can remain successful and employed. Also, fantasy football owners don't have to worry about team chemistry, the makeup of a roster, building teams or managing personalities and emotions. Do NFL teams have a checks-and-balances system in place when it comes to trade acquisitions? There are organizations out there where one person makes all of the decisions, but even there, it's imperative to have a leadership group at least involved in all personnel conversations. Any good operation has a structure that allows one individual to make a final decision. The best operations also have checks and balances in place, or a leader who is willing to empower others to help make decisions for them. The primary leader who has enough respect, trust and security to delegate decision-making to other people -- a group of confidants who can tell the emperor when he has no clothes on -- often has a great deal of success. Why does it feel like the NFL trade deadline isn't as big a deal as it is in the NBA or MLB? I believe this answer is two-fold. First, one player on an NBA team can make a world of difference, and the same thing goes for a great player (pitcher, hitter, fielder, etc.) in baseball. In the NFL, however, so much has to go right even for the best players to make a seismic difference on a team. And second, the trade deadlines in the NBA and MLB are closer to their postseasons. The NFL's trade deadline is much earlier in the regular season, and I believe this is to prevent the kinds of fire sales we see in the other professional sports leagues. With only 17 games in a season, one player makes less of an impact in the immediate future. Follow Scott Pioli on Twitter.

Rankings, Week 6: Five QBs under 30 I'd want to build a franchise around", "author": "David Carr", "date": "Oct 12, 2021 at 01:42 PM", "body": "NFL.com Analyst The NFL is swarming with young quarterback talent. In Week 5 alone, we saw an EPIC comeback from Lamar Jackson, a possible changing of the guard in the AFC thanks to a huge performance Josh Allen and another Kyler Murray-led win for the league's lone undefeated team. With so much excitement surrounding this group of quarterbacks, it's the perfect time for me to take a closer look at these incredible talents. So today, I'm ranking the top five quarterbacks under 30 years old that I'd choose to build a franchise around. Allen has a great combination of arm strength and running ability. He's playing the position better than everyone else heading into Week 6 of the regular season. There isn't anything Allen can't do in the passing game and he's done a great job of evolving in the Bills' run game, especially on RPO plays. Several times in Sunday night's victory vs. Kansas City, I saw Allen not hand the ball off to the running back, decide not to throw it, then follow the running back to where the void was in the defense. I've seen other quarterbacks do that on broken plays but not by choice. Allen is able to process what the defense gives him and make the necessary adjustments -- part of his game that's improved immensely since his rookie season. Mahomes hasn't been as electric in 2021 as he was over the last few seasons. While those struggles have resulted in his exit from my rankings below, he's still one of the league's most gifted and dangerous quarterbacks. You don't get your team to back-to-back Super Bowls without those traits. He can be inconsistent, but his big-play ability and knack for turning broken plays into positive gains are two huge reasons for Kansas City's success since he became the starter in 2018. He is as good as they come in terms of quick decision-making and putting his playmakers in position to win their matchups. Simply put, you can never count the Chiefs out of a game with Mahomes under center. The Chargers' second-year quarterback is the best pocket passer on this list. His ability to see open voids in coverage allows him to throw his receivers open, which is a quality not often seen from young players. Herbert can make all the throws and get the offense out of almost any situation with his arm, but he also uses his legs well enough to be a threat in the run game -- something we quarterbacks like to call \"hidden yardage.\" He's taken the Chargers' offense from good to great in one season, and this unit will continue to rank among the league's best as long as No. 10 stays healthy. This kid is special. The options for play-callers seem limitless when Murray is under center. The dynamic third-year quarterback puts fear into the defense before teams even take the field, as the opposition must prepare to face a guy who can extend plays with his legs and hit pass catchers with accuracy in the pass game. Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Troy Aikman told me early in my career to be ready when my team was in position to contend. That's what we're seeing in Arizona right now. Murray is playing the best football of his career and the team is peaking. That's why the Cardinals have the best record in the league heading into Week 6.  I'm not sure it's possible for a Dallas Cowboys quarterback to be underrated, but to me, Dak doesn't get his due. What has he done other than make clutch plays and put the Cowboys in winning situations late in games? He's improved as a passer, can buy time with his legs and makes good decisions. The moment is never too big for him. I'm on board with everything this guy brings to an offense. There were so many questions surrounding him coming into the 2021 campaign, as he made his way back from the gruesome ankle injury he suffered last season and the shoulder injury that sidelined him in training camp. But those questions were put to rest in Week 1, when he threw for 400-plus yards and nearly led the Cowboys to an upset of the reigning champion Bucs. It's just unfortunate Tom Brady was standing on the sideline opposite him or Dak and the Cowboys would be 5-0 right now. Dak doesn't need to prove anything. The product he puts on the field is more than enough. Each week in the 2021 campaign, former No. 1 overall pick and NFL Network analyst David Carr will take a look at all offensive players and rank his top 15. Rankings are based solely on this season's efforts. The Week 6 pecking order is below. NOTE: Arrows reflect changes from last week's rankings. The AFC tides turned Sunday night thanks to Allen and the Bills. He took control early against the Chiefs' Swiss cheese defense and continued to apply pressure until the end of regulation, finishing with 315 pass yards, three TDs and a 139.1 passer rating, and 11 carries for 59 yards and a rush TD. Allen is showing us he has the goods to take the Bills to the Super Bowl. The Packers don't beat the Bengals without Rodgers. He -- and the Bengals, who had ample opportunities to close the game out -- gave ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿Mason Crosbyï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ four(!) chances to kick the go-ahead field goal in the final three minutes of the fourth quarter and overtime, and Crosby finally connected to give Green Bay the win in overtime. The Packers don't have the best offense when you look at the numbers, but they get the job done when they need it most and that's a credit to Rodgers.  The 49ers held Murray and the Cardinals' offense in check for most of Sunday's game, but the third-year quarterback stepped up to the plate with the team's undefeated season on the line, orchestrating a five-play, 52-yard drive capped by a 9-yard TD pass to DeAndre Hopkins with 5 minutes left. The score and a great defensive performance from Vance Joseph's group secured the victory. Kyler's playing smart football but will be tested by another tough defense next weekend in Cleveland. Let's see if he can help keep the Cards' streak alive. For as much as we've raved about Patrick Mahomes, whose Chiefs are riding the struggle bus, Herbert deserves equal praise for what he's doing in SoCal. In fact, Herbert joined Mahomes on Sunday as the only quarterbacks in the Super Bowl era with at least 40 pass TDs and fewer than 15 INTs in their first 20 starts. Herbert has the Chargers sitting at 4-1 with one contest (at Baltimore) to play before the bye week. After that, it should be smooth sailing until December if Herbert and Co. keep playing like this. Adams torched the Bengals' secondary all game long, whether he separated in his routes or made a contested catch, and ended the game with a career-high 206 receiving yards. The Bengals had no answer for the league's receiving yards leader (579), and to be honest, I'm not sure any team will. Henry absolutely owns the Jaguars and has averaged 103.9 rush yards per game over 11 games against them. In Sunday's win, the two-time rushing champion recorded his fifth career game with at least 130 rush yards and three rush TDs, the most in the NFL since 2010 and tied for fourth-most in NFL history. Only Jim Brown, Barry Sanders and Shaun Alexander have more such games. Henry's putting together an impressive campaign and we're not even to Halloween. What a way to erase the memory of last year's painful Week 5 event. Prescott led the Cowboys to a blowout victory over the division rival Giants and had 302 pass yards, three TDs, one pick and a 116.9 passer rating in the process. Five weeks into the 2021 season, the Cowboys have the league's top overall offense thanks to their quarterback's efficiency, decision-making and leadership. Brian Flores' defense has taken a step back and Brady took full advantage Sunday, posting 411 pass yards, five pass TDs and a 144.4 pass rating (all season highs). At some point, it feels like there can't be anymore firsts for Brady, but he had 400-plus pass yards and at least five pass TDs in a game for the first time in his career, including the playoffs (351 games). That has to be the last first right? In a defensive battle between the Cardinals and 49ers, Hopkins took the game into his own hands late in the fourth quarter with back-to-back big plays. The first was a 30-yard reception to put the Cardinals in the red zone and he followed it up on the next play with a 9-yard touchdown catch with Josh Norman draped all over him. This is what the NFL's best playmakers do, and Hopkins, who's no stranger to game-changing plays, took charge when the Cards needed him most. Lamar Jackson is something else. I thought the Ravens were toast after his critical fumble on the Colts' 1-yard line in the third quarter. But with a short memory, Lamar helped the Ravens score 16 unanswered points to send the game to overtime after Colts kicker Rodrigo Blankenship missed a field goal at the end of regulation. Jackson then led his team on a 10-play, 68-yard game-winning drive in overtime that ended in a 5-yard TD connection between Lamar and Marquise Brown. Man, what a performance from the 2019 NFL MVP. Kelce's 1-yard touchdown reception in the fourth quarter of Sunday night's loss to Buffalo put him at four for the season, tied for second-most among tight ends. The Chiefs have lost three of their last four, but they have a good chance to get back on track next week against Washington. Kelce can be the one to lead the charge as a major mismatch for a struggling defense. With seven catches for 63 yards against the Bills, Hill reached 400 career receptions in his 79th career game, making him the second-fastest Chiefs player to hit that mark since the 1970 merger, according to NFL Research. However, Hill's outing had its flaws. The most significant blunder came in the third quarter, when the Chiefs trailed 24-13. A Mahomes pass went through Hill's hands and right into those of Bills safety Micah Hyde, who returned the interception for a TD. That turn of events proved to be too much for the Chiefs, as they never came within 10 points of Buffalo the rest of the way. Sean McVay made good on his promise to get Robert Woods \"more opportunities\" but more Woods didn't mean less Kupp. The latter finished with seven receptions for 92 yards in the Rams' 26-17 win over the Seahawks. In fact, Kupp is the only player in the league to receive at least 10 targets in all of his team's games this season.  Ranked second in the league in passing yards, Carr is constantly under pressure from opposing defenses. This Raiders' passing attack requires someone other than All-Pro tight end Darren Waller to consistently step up and provide a secondary option. Things won't get easier for this unit next week as Las Vegas travels to Denver to face the league's second-best scoring defense after head coach Jon Gruden's resignation on Monday night. On a day when the Raiders struggled to generate any sort of offense, Waller recorded a season-low 45 receiving yards on four catches (he had two drops, per Pro Football Focus). It snapped a nine-game streak with at least 50 receiving yards in a game dating back to Week 13 of 2020. One part of Waller's game that doesn't get enough attention is his blocking ability as he's constantly paving the way for the ground game and other pass catchers.

"body": "NFL.com Columnist Jon Gruden's stunning and swift downfall Monday night, only hours after the New York Times reported that a trove of his emails in the NFL's possession included years of messages containing homophobic and misogynistic language, and the sharing of topless photos, one of which was of Washington Football Team cheerleaders, was well-earned. His career is in tatters after his resignation from the Las Vegas Raiders, four years into a 10-year contract, and he deserves no sympathy. But don't kid yourself. Gruden is hardly the only person in the NFL who thinks and talks that way. He is merely one of the most high-profile and well-compensated, and certainly one of the dumbest, for putting it all in writing. \"I love the Raiders and do not want to be a distraction,\" Gruden wrote in a statement Monday night. \"Thank you to all the players, coaches, staff, and fans of Raider Nation. I'm sorry, I never meant to hurt anyone.\" That, of course, is laughable. Gruden didn't mean to hurt anybody because he wasn't even thinking of anybody but himself, his frat-like circle of friends, and their amusement. The rest -- minorities, women, gay players -- were collateral damage. Gruden's behavior -- and how it came to light -- casts a considerable cloud over the league's efforts toward diversity. Those who have hired the female game officials he reportedly denounced, who supported player protests of racial injustice, who applauded Carl Nassib (a Raider, no less) when he became the NFL's first openly gay active player -- those people in the NFL have tried hard to rid the league of its good-old-boy ways. But Gruden was one of the most popular broadcasters on ESPN's Monday Night Football among those in the NFL before he returned to being one of the league's star coaches. These emails -- which spanned years, before he made his triumphant return to the Raiders -- undermine it all. Most striking about this entire episode was Gruden's casual use of language that the league wants you to think is now verboten in its meeting rooms. Gruden's use of a racial trope when he criticized NFL Players Association leader DeMaurice Smith, as first reported by the Wall Street Journal, seemed so unremarkable to him that he claimed over the weekend to not even remember sending such an email. That he felt comfortable enough using that language and so much more that he put it in writing -- that he put it in writing to a longtime Washington team executive -- says plenty about the atmosphere in which Gruden operated. He never expected to be caught, of course, and the fact that he used the language so freely says he knew it was acceptable to his audience. Those \"Inspire Change\" messages in the stadiums ring a little more hollow right now, don't they? Gruden's emails were in the NFL's -- and then the Raiders' -- hands because they were captured during the investigation into workplace conditions at the Washington Football Team. Bruce Allen, a former top team executive, used his company email in his exchanges with Gruden, the Times reported. Once the workplace investigation was completed, a source said, the league was told it should review about 650,000 emails that the law firm had uncovered. A team of senior league executives have been doing that for the past few months. Finally, last week, their findings were presented to Commissioner Roger Goodell. The Raiders knew of them for at least three days while the league waited for them to handle the burgeoning crisis -- with Gruden coaching on Sunday and making ill-advised comments all along. Finally, with more emails coming to light on Monday evening, Gruden resigned. The workplace conduct investigation yielded a $10 million fine for the WFT and an agreement that owner Daniel Snyder would stay away from running the team for an unspecified period of time. But there was no written report from the investigation. Attorney Beth Wilkinson, who led the probe, delivered her findings orally to the NFL, with the league saying it was to protect the women who had come forward. Given the content of the sliver of emails that were connected to Gruden, you'd have to be pretty naÃ¯ve not to believe that what Wilkinson found connected to the Washington Football Team and the toxic environment Snyder allowed there was at least as troubling as, and potentially worse than, Gruden's reported remarks. We might never know that -- Snyder's emails didn't leak -- but remember that the recipient of Gruden's emails, Allen, apparently felt comfortable enough receiving Gruden's vitriol that he let them arrive on his company email at Snyder's team. Men like Allen are the ones who hire coaches and other executives. They are the ones responsible for diversifying the ranks of NFL decision-makers. Remember that power structure, and what the reported content of Gruden's emails revealed about the thinking within it, the next time the hiring cycle begins or an employee alleges workplace harassment. Gruden isn't alone in his thinking; his just came to light, to devastating effect. But there are others who think and talk like Gruden, and some of them have influential jobs, too. Some of them are likely hitting delete tonight. The damage all of them have done for years can't be undone that easily. Follow Judy Battista on Twitter.

Battista", "date": "Oct 10, 2021 at 10:11 PM", "body": "NFL.com Columnist The NFL is a week-to-week, sometimes minute-to-minute, game of last man standing -- ask Packers kicker Mason Crosby -- but five weeks into the season, patterns have started to emerge about the toll injuries and team weaknesses are going to have on the season. For every Packers escape of Crosby's nightmarish day, there are the Miami Dolphins, whose disappearing defense is at least as much of a problem as ï»¿Tua Tagovailoaï»¿'s injuries. Who can survive such travails? We're asking the same question after Sunday. The entire league has to be wondering if it can survive its kickers. Through the late afternoon games, there were 24 missed kicks on Sunday -- 12 missed extra points, 12 missed field goals. The 12 missed extra points ties the record in the Super Bowl era for most missed extra points in a single week. There were seven missed extra points by halftime of the early games Sunday, including one in the second half of Thursday night's game between the Rams and Seahawks. In eight minutes of game time spanning the end of regulation and the start of overtime, the Packers and Bengals combined for five missed field goals -- all potential game winners -- until Crosby, who missed three of them, finally hit a 49-yarder for the victory. Antacids all around, because kickers aren't going anywhere and the weather hasn't even turned. The Seahawks (2-3) will have to get by without Russell Wilson for at least a month as he recovers from hand surgery, a loss compounded by the startlingly poor start of Seattle's defense. They entered Week 5 ranked last in yards allowed. The next three games are against the Steelers, Saints and Jaguars -- none of them reliable offensive juggernauts this season -- before a bye. Geno Smith is a competent backup, but the Seahawks are already at the bottom of the brutal NFC West, so he will have to win a few of those games to give Wilson a chance for heroics when he returns. Sunday was devastating for the New York Giants. Both Daniel Jones and Saquon Barkley had to be carted off during a loss to the Cowboys, compounding how shorthanded the offense already was without two starting receivers and a missing starting left tackle. And then receiver Kenny Golladay went down, too. The Giants were down six of 11 offensive starters, and not many teams could survive that kind of attrition. The defense, which keyed their second-half resurgence last season, hasn't been as stout this year. Worse, the Giants (1-4) still have a brutal schedule ahead, with the Rams next week and upcoming meetings with the Chiefs and Bucs still to come before Thanksgiving. The Dolphins are one boffo defensive play from 0-5, and even Tagovailoa's return -- and upcoming games against the Jaguars and Falcons -- can't make up for a defense that cannot get off the field on third down. The Bucs converted eight of 11 third-down attempts -- 72.7 percent! -- and were able to hold the ball nearly 15 full minutes longer than the Dolphins. Want to write that off to Tom Brady? You can't. The defense entered the game 31st in the league in third-down conversions allowed; they were first in third-down defense last season, which helped propel them to the cusp of a playoff berth. The offense has shown signs of life even without Tagovailoa, and it is clearly going to fall to the offense to resuscitate this season. Don't expect the Deshaun Watson scuttlebutt to quiet anytime soon. The Patriots eked out a win over the Houston Texans, but they did two things Sunday that losing teams do: They lost a fumble at the goal line -- they have lost four fumbles in five games -- and their secondary struggled dramatically, with busted coverages on third-and-long plays and on slants. New England deserves credit for coming from behind to win the game -- Mac Jones and his mental toughness will clearly be the bright spot of this season -- but those are errors we're not used to seeing from the Patriots, and they are ones they must clean up to keep a playoff dream alive. Everybody loves the Taylor Heinicke story, but the Washington Football Team has a problem with the defense that was touted as one of the best in the league before the season began. That defense was second in the league last season. It entered Sunday ranked 29th in total defense, 30th in scoring defense and dead last on third down. After Sunday, this unit is no longer just overrated or underachieving. It's just downright bad, particularly in the back seven. There was a 72-yard touchdown pass and a 49-yard Hail Mary touchdown at the end of the first half. Washington has talked a lot about attention to detail, but, at 2-3 and with the Cowboys pulling away in the division, the team has to hurry up and pay attention: Three of the next four quarterbacks this defense faces are Patrick Mahomes , Aaron Rodgers and Tom Brady. The Bucs are obviously a threat to repeat as champions, but they are going to have to survive something they didn't have to contend with last season: a rash of injuries on defense. On Sunday, standout linebacker Lavonte David went down with an ankle injury. That was on top of the absence of three starting defensive backs. If there is any bright side here, it is that the Bucs' next three opponents are the Eagles, Bears and Saints -- all of whom entered the weekend in the bottom half of the league in scoring -- before the bye week. That gives Richard Sherman time to get settled in, and others time to heal for the stretch run. No matter the issues, there is little doubt the Bucs will be in it. The Carolina Panthers and ï»¿Sam Darnoldï»¿'s renaissance have been one of the delightful surprises of the first month of the season, but they have come back to Earth in the last two weeks -- both losses -- mostly because of leaky offensive line play. On Sunday, Darnold threw three interceptions, and he got clobbered, getting sacked three times and hit eight times. Last week, he was sacked five times and hit 11. The Panthers aren't alone with offensive line woes, but they have very little room for error. Follow Judy Battista on Twitter.

life", "author": "None", "date": "Sep 24, 2021 at 10:31 AM", "body": "LB, Tampa Bay Buccaneers EDITOR'S NOTE: For more on a story near and dear to Tampa Bay Buccaneers linebacker Devin White's heart, watch next week's episode of NFL Network's NFL 360, which airs at 8 p.m. ET on Tuesday, Sept. 28. Emotions run high on game days with cheers from thousands of the world's greatest fans coming in waves, but one ritual is always part of my routine before kickoff, no matter what. I pray to my late brother -- J'Marco \"Jae Jae\" Greenard, who died in a car accident in June 2011 when he was 19 years old and I was 13 -- asking him not to just be with me but to play through me. And though he's not there in person, I can feel him with me every time I step foot on the field. I looked up to Jae Jae so much growing up. His mentorship shines through every part of me, but it's his work ethic and positive outlook that continue to make the biggest impact on my life. As kids growing up in Cotton Valley, Louisiana, we were both very active and his determination to be a great athlete pushed me to reach my own goals. I loved seeing Jae Jae in the spotlight and his success in sports -- he won a state track championship his senior year -- motivated me to become the guy everyone looked up to in my own sport. People were thrilled to watch him compete at meets, but what they didn't see was the work he put in when no one was watching. We didn't have a track in Cotton Valley, a small, rural town in northwestern Louisiana, but I remember watching Jae Jae run up and down the hill near our home. He and his dad, Willie Standokes (my stepfather), even figured out how many times Jae Jae would have to run around our single-wide trailer to equal a mile. He was always out there sprinting and working on his speed. His work ethic was phenomenal, and it spoke volumes about his determination that he accomplished so much despite having so little. I knew I needed to put in the work, like Jae Jae did, to get where I wanted to go. Following his example has no doubt paid off in my football career so far, having been a member of a Super Bowl-winning team in my second NFL season after being drafted fifth overall out of LSU in 2019. Yet, there's still so much left for me to do. Jae Jae was a light for those around him away from athletics, too. He was able to make his family members, friends or even strangers smile and laugh. His positivity was contagious, and that's the trait I try to emulate the most. I pride myself on being a big energy guy who everyone wants to be around. And I think most people inside the Buccaneers organization would tell you I'm one of the more upbeat guys at work. Whether it's Day 1 of training camp when everyone is excited for the beginning of a new season or Day 150 when we're grinding late in the year, I'm still bringing that same energy. We have to enjoy every part of life while we're here because our time could come at any moment. Jae Jae taught me that. With my brother playing such an important role in my upbringing, I've embraced paying it forward and being a mentor for the next generation. I've taken two kids from Cotton Valley -- Xavier McGlothan and Jacobreious Walker -- under my wing in recent years, showing them new opportunities from bringing them to Bucs games to riding horses back home. I want what's best for them and all the kids I get to meet. One of the greatest parts of mentoring is seeing your positive influence on their lives but it's also rewarding to see what the kids teach you. Xavier, Jacobreious and others have taught me patience. It's funny when I look back because Jae Jae probably experienced the same thing hanging around me when we were growing up. Having had an incredible guide in Jae Jae, who made such an impression on me and altered how I approach life, I have a deep appreciation for the meaningful impact I can have on kids in the community as a professional football player. It's something I don't take for granted, and I know it's how I can keep Jae Jae's memory alive. Follow Devin White on Twitter.

We have answers. At least we hope. Start 'Em & Sit 'Em has helped fantasy managers for years make those pressing lineup decisions. And you know what is a good decision? Starting Patrick Mahomesï»¿. But that's too obvious, so you won't see that here. Instead here are some of the most-pressing questions. And, if you can't find a player you are looking for, please check out latest NFL Fantasy lineup rankings right here. Dawson has been amazing, even if his current pace doesnât seem sustainable. I mean, itâs not like there are a ton of tight ends who can turn four targets into 117 yards and a touchdown. But Iâm riding the wave until it crashes. Can it be this week against the Titans? Maybe. The Titans have allowed the third-fewest points per game to the position this season. Iâm however not walking away while the table is hot. And if you do, donât look back. Thereâs nothing worse than leaving your spot on the blackjack table and then having that person win tons of money. Donât do that to yourself. If you bench Knox, donât even watch the game. Well, watch Chris Rose do the highlights after right here on NFL Network (cheap pop). But donât watch the game.   Hockenson has had a rough go of it in recent weeks. Which I guess could be the story for any member of the Detroit Lions. I mean, how do you keep going after losing games like that time and time again. Hockenson has run less routes recently because of injuries on the offensive line, but look for him to get back into the mix against the Bengals this week.  Game played at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London.  Itâs always a roller coaster ride for Gesicki. It always seems like Iâm sweating out his production. I mean, couldnât you just throw a few early targets his way? The best news is that heâs scored at least eight points in three consecutive games, and double-digit points in two of his last three.  Tight ends are volatile. And itâs hard to trust a lot of them. Higbee has been streaky, scoring a touchdown in two of his last three games. But I have a motto. If youâre going to take a risk on a tight end, at least make it on a prolific offense. Noah scored just five points in a loss to the Steelers just the week before. But he was on the field for 97% of the snaps which is amazing. Itâs only a matter of time before the production shows up, too. The Raiders have allowed the sixth-most fantasy points to tight ends over the last two weeks. Game played at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London.  Arnold finished with double-digit points for the first time in his career with the Jaguars. Hey look, he just got traded there, so donât be all weird about it. He could have had a bigger day but he did lose a fumble. But he did have team-high categories in targets (eight) and receptions (six). Letâs not get crazy about Njoku, who had a huge touchdown against the Chargers. Now, big part of that was because Nasir Adderley went for the \"Peanut Punch\" and didnât bother to try to tackle him. And thatâs not to mean Njoku isnât capable of big plays. But Iâd rather roll the dice with a guy who has more sustainability. There is an opportunity with the Washington Football Team with Ian Thomas out this week. This is a good matchup because Dawson Knox had great success against the Chiefs last week. But thatâs too much of a risk for even me to take. Though Iâm sure Iâm going to do it at some point. Big Bob was huge last season and heâs still riding that reputation. Tonyan was solid against the Lions in Week 2 going for 14.2 points. Since that time, heâs scored less than three points in every game this season. Iâm sure Iâm manifesting a 20-point game by just mentioning this here, but needed to bring it up. This guy. I picked him up two weeks ago and got nothing. Drop him, and he scores a touchdown. We didnât see much D.J. Moore last week, so I feel like last week could be an aberration. Iâm going to pass on Tremble until I see some more consistency out of him.  FollowAdam Rankon Twitter. You have lineup questions. We have answers. At least we hope.

And, if you can't find a player you are looking for, please check out latest NFL Fantasy lineup rankings right here. Game played at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London.  Robinson had his first 100-yard game of the season, and fifth of his career last week. And if ï»¿ï»¿Trevor Lawrenceï»¿ï»¿ would stop taking his touchdowns, he could really be on to something. Just kidding, dude has scored at least 20 points in three consecutive games. Love the matchup this week against the Dolphins who have allowed the second-most fantasy points to running backs this season. Henderson has been great when heâs been available. I mean, I didnât want it to seem as harsh as that was when I wrote that. Because heâs only missed one game. But heâs scored at least 15 points in all four of his games this season. Great matchup this week against the Giants who have allowed a lot of points to running backs this year. Including big games to both ï»¿Ezekiel Elliottï»¿ and ï»¿Tony Pollardï»¿ last week. Both of them. Weâve been trying to make Javonte a thing this whole season and it appears like the time is now for him to take over. The matchup should be good against the Raiders. I mean, the Bears ran the ball really well against Las Vegas last week. I mean, they also liked rolling out like eight linemen at times. But still, there was a commitment to the run. And I expect the Broncos to look at that tape and try to do the same thing here.  The FPA (fantasy points against -- which would have been easier to just type out in the first place instead of going through all of this trouble) says that you should sit Jacobs because the Broncos have allowed the second-fewest fantasy points per game to running backs. But Jacobs was really good against the Broncos last season. And those plays that he made exist in my mind, so Iâm going to need to go ahead and play him this week. Seriously. I almost feel silly that I have to mention Gibby here in this space. Heâs one of the top running backs. You likely scooped him up early in your drafts. But then there are people on social media apps moaning that heâs too touchdown dependent. And I have to admit Iâm guilty of being dependent on running backs who have scored double digits in all but one game this season. Also KCâs defense hasnât been great this year. BTW, Iâm not going to make the desk code on this up, but the FT defense has been just as bad recently. Darrel Williams is a nice sleeper this week if youâre in need. And if youâre confusing Darrel with Damien Williams -- which Iâve seen some TV shows run the wrong B-roll -- both Williamses, whether their current or former Chiefs running backs, are good plays.  Game played at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London.  Iâm not really encouraged by the fact that he had just five rushes. But ten targets is significant. And targets carry more weight than rushes, so it might average out. The matchup is good enough against the Jaguars this week so Iâm using Gaskin as a flex option this week. I mean it still feels like point chasing, but weâre running out of some options so Iâm going to allow it.  Edmonds had been doing pretty well as that running back who put up a ton of fantasy points without getting into the end zone. Well, other than to congratulate his teammates who had actually scored. Last week wasnât great. And in fairness heâs battled an injury. But the Browns have allowed the fifth-fewest points to running backs this year. And thatâs after allowing a huge game to ï»¿Austin Ekelerï»¿.  Harris also battled an injury last week, though he did return to the game. There has been a lot of Rhamondre Stevensonï»¿, though he wasnât very effective. The Cowboys are one of the toughest teams against the run. And if the game script tilts one way, we could possibly see more Brandon Bolden or maybe a surprise appearance by J.J. Taylor. Iâm not letting Taylor go, either. You all wanted me to dump Giovani Bernard and look at how chagrined you are right now. Just kidding, random dudes on Twitter rarely admit when they are wrong. Although it did happen this week and it was pretty cool. Ingram had 16 attempts against the Patriots on Sunday. He gained just 41 yards with a long of eight yards. And I know the Colts FPA is pretty decent right now because the Ravens didnât try to run the ball a whole lot but I do see the Texans running the ball a lot more. And since Ingram falls behind David Johnson on passing downs, Iâm going to avoid Ingram. Follow Adam Rank on Twitter. You have lineup questions. We have answers. At least we hope.

And, if you can't find a player you are looking for, please check out latest NFL Fantasy lineup rankings right here. Youâre sort of dead to me McPherson after missing that kick at the end of regulation against the Packers. I was so ready to celebrate with you. But itâs not like it was a gimmie-kick by any stretch of the imagination. Not even close. So I wonât hold that against you. And the Lions have allowed the most points to kickers this season so Iâm going to get you into the lineup.  Oh my gosh, the fact this dude missed a bunch of kicks against the Bengals just about ensures that heâs going to have 20 fantasy points against my Bears. The Bears have been pretty good at stalling out some drives in the past couple of weeks. Iâm an optimistic Bears fan, but Iâm rooting for field goals here. Sue me.  The Cardinals have allowed the sixth-fewest fantasy points to opposing kickers this season. But the Browns offense is pretty good. They move the ball. I expect them to get into field goal range enough, and then have to go for field goals. Kind of like what I was saying about about Crosby, but only I actually believe it here. Iâm listing him here for a couple of reasons. Dome kickers going outdoors -- especially where the weather can get nasty -- are players I avoid. And he scored five points last week and even missed a field goal. But as long as heâs the kicker for one of the top offenses in the game, Iâm riding with him this week. Iâm taking a huge leap even assuming heâs going to be the Chargers' kicker this week. And even bigger leap that Brandon Staley wonât just start going for two every time they score a touchdown. If you read the open -- shame on you if you didnât -- you know the Chargers are seven for eight on fourth downs. And itâs stuff like this as to why the Chargers donât settle for a lot of field goals. At some point they might just stop carrying a kicker. Or just figure out if ï»¿Austin Ekelerï»¿  could boot extra points. Could you imagine a world like that?  Joseph had just a point in Week 4 against the Browns, but more than made up for it with 17 points against the Lions last week. Which is why we love McPherson this week. But the Panthers have allowed the fewest points to opposing kickers this season and this could be lower scoring like the last couple of Vikings games have been.  Again, we should be preparing ourselves for the Titans upset this week and things like that looking highly suspicious in hindsight. But at the same time, Iâd much rather look at some other kicking options if I needed to stream a player this week. I mean, I donât understand why Rodrigo is still available in a lot of leagues.  Well Bill Belichick had to suffer two weeks ago when Tom Brady returned to Foxboro to face him. And it was rough. But now, thankfully, Belichick gets to be on the other side of things for the ï»¿Nick Folkï»¿  REVENGE GAME against his former team. Iâm just happy that things are working out in Belichickâs favor for once.  Follow Adam Rank on Twitter. You have lineup questions. We have answers. At least we hope.

We have answers. At least we hope. Start 'Em & Sit 'Em has helped fantasy managers for years make those pressing lineup decisions. And you know what is a good decision? StartingÂ Patrick Mahomesï»¿. But that's too obvious, so you won't see that here. Instead here are some of the most-pressing questions. And, if you can't find a player you are looking for, please check outÂ latest NFL Fantasy lineup rankings right here. The Cowboys are coming off a solid performance against the Giants in Week 5. And I donât want to get ahead of myself here but, could the Cowboys defense be considered good? I mean, maybe right? Or at least Trevon Diggs is really good. Love the matchup this week against the Patriots who surrender a lot of points to fantasy defenses. I had to add the Colts defenses in a number of spots this week because, well, I kind of forgot on Sunday and it was them or the Chiefs. And I wasnât about to do that. I picked the Colts mostly because of this matchup against the Texans. And I was hoping they didnât get negative points against the Ravens. It wasnât much, but it was positive. This isnât automatic because the Patriots had just four points against the Texans last week, but Iâll allow this streaming option. The Bengals actually scored four points against the Packers last week. Thatâs like 20 against a normal team. Hey look, I have to be honest. Iâm starting to feel really sad for the Lions. They donât deserve all of this rotten luck that has fallen on them this season. And maybe they put up 60 on the Bengals. I feel like the Lions are due for a breakout game. But Iâm willing to take a risk here. Game played at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London.  The Dolphins havenât looked right since they got blown out at home against the Bills. Then there was that last-second loss to the Raiders, a loss to the Colts and a terrible showing against the Buccaneers. And they used to do really well against Tom Brady. But thereâs nothing wrong with streaming a defense against a rookie quarterback. Iâd love to do it against Zach Wilson, but heâs off this week. (Not that you care, I never spell Zachâs name right the first time.) Speaking of teams to stream against the Jaguars, here are the Titans. And I told you to stream the Titans last week. And if I didnât, it was out of respect to AEW. But hereâs my thing. I donât think Iâm doing you a great service by telling you to bench the Titans. But you might have forgotten you picked them up and this is your reminder to remove them.  The Patriots were rostered in 70 percent of leagues on Sunday. Iâm sure that changed over the past couple of days. But like the Titans, a lot of us picked up the Patriots for the matchup against ï»¿Davis Millsï»¿. And yeah, that worked out PERFECTLY. I mean, they smoked ï»¿Justin Herbertï»¿ last year, but Mills goes nuts against the Patriots. Thatâs just wonderful. A lot of you wouldnât dream of benching the Ravens. Dude, James Koh and I have the Browns defense in a league where we are co-managers. We got negative six from our defense last week. I didnât even know that was possible. It was worth one point in NFL.com leagues. Still not great, so they have to hit the bench. And as much as we loved watching Lamar Jackson on Monday night, dude really bailed out that defense. That got lit up by Carson Wentz. Carson. Wentz.  The Chargers actually had negative two points going up against the Browns last week. Which is too bad, because the Cardinals have been a good defense this year. Eight points last week against the 49ers. Still, if you have some better options, go for it. I mean, I donât blame you if you have to start the Birds. I just donât like it. Follow Adam Rank on Twitter. You have lineup questions. We have answers. At least we hope.

But that's too obvious, so you won't see that here. Instead here are some of the most-pressing questions. And, if you can't find a player you are looking for, please check out latest NFL Fantasy lineup rankings right here. Am I a points chaser? I am. Do I care? I donât. Not with this matchup. The Seahawks have allowed a top seven fantasy wide receiver in three straight games. You love this matchup. And JuJu Smith-Schuster (out for the year with a shoulder injury) and his 6.8 targets per game are now up for grabs as well. I have no problem with this. Itâs not always going to be this way for the Steelers, but you might as well cash in. Itâs like being in Seattle when itâs sunny (although Seattle gets less rainfall than NYC), you need to take advantage of your opportunities.  We need to monitor the injury situation here for the Giants, as it seems like everyone is afflicted. Not just for Toney, but for Daniel Jones, too. But we did notice that Mike Glennon really likes to go after Toney so thatâs a plus. Toneyâs targets, yards and fantasy points have increased in three straight. Heâs the WR7 since Week 4. Dude is pretty good.  Letâs talk about a former Giant. Now, itâs disappointing to see the Browns put up nearly half a hundred points, and OBJ not really be involved. But heâs had at least 140+ air yards in two of his three games this season. Cleveland has the fourth-most total yards this year, and Arizona has allowed a receiving touchdown to a wide receiver in every game this year. Iâm not saying heâs going to be a WR1 this week, but Iâm cool with him. Um, did you see his touchdown on Monday night? And Iâll have you know I had Pittman listed here before the game. Monday night preserved it. Or entrenched it. You get me. Maybe the word is validated. But hereâs my thing, heâs had a 29 percent target share since Week 2 -- thatâs ninth in the NFL. Heâs the WR17 since that time, too. Solid WR2 with a great matchup. Honestly, that Moss-like catch happened so late at night, you might be able to steal him in a trade if youâre looking for something. Cooks did not have a great game last week. I need you to keep it in perspective, though. He is a starter for most teams with three receivers and whatnot, so donât overreact to one week. Not with a guy who is second in the NFL with a 34 percent target share. The Colts have allowed 10 receiving touchdowns to wideouts this year, which is the most in the NFL. So chill, brah.  I blessed Sutton by making him a âsitâ last week, and that worked out for those of you who like to fade my advice. Look, youâre not hurting my feelings. What is important to note here is that you canât really judge the Raiders by fantasy points against. The Bears basically just ran the ball at will on them. But I like Sutton because his targets and receiving yards have increased in two straight games. Heâs also second in the NFL with 128 air yards per game. So there you are. Game played at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London.  You know, I thought about sitting Jones this week because Dan Arnold was getting a lot of love. Even Tavon Austin was getting into the mix. But again, with players who are most likely your WR3 or flex option, itâs important to not overreact. We drafted them late for a reason. Obviously, if you have Mike Williams and Marvin (like I do in a number of leagues) you can make some adjustments. The targets will correct themselves this week and weâre going to be just fine. I faded Beasley during the offseason because I felt like it was just a matter of time before Emmanuel Sanders passed him up in this offense. But now it looks like Dawson Knox is getting a lot of opportunities, as well. And at some point, I expect to hear from Gabriel Davis as well. Heâs kind of like Dolph Ziggler in a way. Heâs good. Really good. But heâs out of the main event scene right now. Besides Dolph is really good at comedy. Iâm serious, heâs legit hilarious. As good as Dolph is as a worker, he might be better as a comic. Sorry, I know this was supposed to be about sitting Cole, but I donât think I had anything else to add there.  We loved Robby as low-end WR2/WR3 type coming into drafts this year because of this offense and history with Sam Darnold. But itâs been D.J. Moore to the moon this season. And if Christian McCaffrey is back this week, then it moves him down the pecking order as well.  Game played at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London.  The matchup seems good enough. And I might end up regretting this one. It seems like I bless a receiver each week by making him a sit. My guess itâs Waddle this week. Iâd start Waddle over guys like Tim Patrick, Laviska Shenault and Tyler Boyd. Even Rondale Moore. Consider those guys sits as well, but again, for my hard-working edit desk who are subjected to my stupid movie and wrestling references and weird analogies, they deserve a break.

And, if you can't find a player you are looking for, please check out latest NFL Fantasy lineup rankings right here. I know, a super-chalky pick right out of the gate. But I just wanted to point out that heâs had at least 275 passing yards in every game this season. The only quarterback who has done that. The Giants have allowed at least two touchdown passes in four of five games this year. New York has also allowed the sixth-most fantasy points to quarterbacks this year. Allow me this one. Plus, I feel like the Rams not only feel the heat to keep up with the Cardinals, but the Chargers. The battle for L.A. is real. I mean, I donât love the fact that he visited the hospital on Sunday night for a possible throat contusion. Which, as my friend pointed out, people throw around the word contusion way too much. But I digress. Burrow has two touchdown passes in every game this season. Only Patrick Mahomes can make that claim. Wait, not even Justin Herbertï»¿? Thatâs wild. The Lions arenât the pushover everyone seems to think. I mean, itâs the Lions. And they find heartbreaking ways to lose that make their coach cry. But not a pushover. But they have allowed 26.2 offensive points per game (seventh in the NFL). The Raiders did not play well on Sunday. They didnât look like they were in sync. I mean, they looked like Joey Fatone, when they need to look like Justin Timberlake. You know what Iâm saying? Denver should help them get back on track this week. Derek had 371 passing yards to go with two touchdowns and two picks last season. Denver has been really tough on quarterbacks over the last two weeks. But I have confidence that this Raiders team is going to pull it together. Game played at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London.  Itâs crazy. Like AEW is the hottest wrestling organization right now and itâs super fun to watch. And itâs making people fall in love with the sport all over again. I just keep waiting for that to happen with the Jaguars. Maybe Don Callis should just coach the team? But if you havenât been paying attention, Lawrence has increased his fantasy points in three consecutive games. Heâs rushed for a touchdown in back-to-back games. And Miami has allowed the third-most fantasy points to quarterbacks since Week 3. I mean, itâs going to turn around for the Chiefs at some point. Or it had better. Because that defense looks miserable. The Chiefs have allowed a Top-4 fantasy quarterback in four consecutive games. Hereâs a fun factoid: The Chiefs have allowed 32.6 points per game this season. The Football Team has allowed 31 points per game. This is going to be a shootout. If youâre down a quarterback, this would be one of my top picks off the waiver wire. Hear me out on this. Just listen (or read, you can listen to my podcast or NFL Fantasy Live or Total Access). Tannehill is going to have a good game against the Bills. And I know, I know, the Bills have been one of the best against quarterbacks this season. But this is the NFL. You donât win a huge game on the road like the Bills did without a bit of a letdown. Iâm not saying the Bills lose. Iâm just saying the Titans play better than you are thinking. And many of you will want to sit Tannehill this week, and I canât advise that. I was set to list him as a âsitâ this week. But I canât do it.  Watching Roethlisberger on Sunday, I felt his game was actually better than his final fantasy point total. But he was out there like the Undertaker in like every match after WrestleMania XXX where he needs to be carried by his opponent. But he's still capable. BTW, thatâs more pro-Roman Reigns than negative UT. Hereâs my thing. The Seahawks have allowed a 300-yard passer in four consecutive games. They have allowed the fourth-most fantasy points to quarterbacks since Week 3. Iâm not saying that heâs going to have a 30-point game. But I do feel like he can be serviceable in a pinch. I know, youâre welcome. No, I had Jones going against the Texans last week and it didnât work out. Plus, I also thought that maybe the Texans would force the Patriots into a game script where they had to throw the football. Thatâs still a little bit too risky for me. Feels weird to bench Wentz after he had the game of his life against the Ravens on Monday night. But I donât want to chase the points, and Iâm expecting a huge letdown after blowing that lead. Besides, Iâd rather play the quarterback more than I would the matchup. Even though I have Roethlisberger listed as a start. Iâm just worried about this one. Plus, I like a good ï»¿Jonathan Taylorï»¿ and ï»¿Nyheim Hinesï»¿ game here, so Iâm staying away from the quarterback. I see him being solid, but not startable. I know, I know. But when youâre looking around for quarterbacks your mind has that muscle memory and you look for teams like the Bengals to stream your quarterbacks against. Iâm not going to do that here. Or at least you shouldnât. Goff has produced single-digit point totals in two of his last three weeks. And really, outside of garbage time in Week 1 against the 49ers, it hasnât happened. Iâve also noticed all of the Lions marks who were talking trash to me on social media early in the season have gone away. Follow Adam Rank on Twitter. You have lineup questions. We have answers.

"author": "Marcas Grant", "date": "Oct 12, 2021 at 07:56 PM", "body": "Fantasy Editor We've reached the point in the season when things stop being new. We've formedÂ educated opinionsÂ on players. We've learned which teams we can target and which ones we can avoid.Â SoÂ it gets easier, right?Â  *uncontrollableÂ laughter*Â  You must be new here.Â  Of course, it doesn't get any easier. Consider me grateful for that. Otherwise, I'd probably be out of a gig.Â And I like eating, so we don't need any of that to happen. If anything, this is when it gets harder. Injuries are piling upÂ andÂ teams are onÂ byes. Players who wereÂ surprisingÂ at the start of the year are now just expected to produce every week. (Looking at you, ï»¿Cordarrelle Pattersonï»¿.)Â  But you didn't come here to hear (read) me whining. You want sleepers. Enough out of me. Let's list off some names!Â  If I haven't yet hit the limit on how many times I can includeÂ ï»¿Taylor Heinickeï»¿Â *in this column, then I'm probably close.Â Since taking over for ï»¿Ryan Fitzpatrickï»¿, Heinicke has been aÂ solid streaming option. He ranks as a top 12 fantasy quarterback over the past four weeks and has excelled in favorable matchups. He's got one of those this week against the Chiefs.Â Kansas City's defense has been equallyÂ putridÂ on the ground and through the air. What works in Heinicke's favor is that Washington's defense has also beenÂ ungoodÂ this year. Look for both offenses to beÂ very aerial in a potential high-scoring contest.* Darrel Williams will be a popular name off waivers this week. The veteran backup will take over as Kansas City's starter in place of ï»¿Clyde Edwards-Helaireï»¿. If you were able to snag Williams, there's no time like the present to get him in your lineup. Did I mention that Washington's defense has been bad? Because â¦ yeah. The Football Team has allowed six receiving touchdowns to running backs, which seems pertinent when discussing a running back who could see a fair number of targets. Don't look now, but ï»¿Carson Wentzï»¿ has been steady. His 22.58 fantasy points against the Ravens on Monday night were the most he's scored all year. But he's had a consistent floor of around 17.5 points this season. This week, he faces the Texans. To be fair, Houston's defense hasn't been awful. It also hasn't been great. Of the five quarterbacks to face the Texans, only ï»¿Mac Jonesï»¿ didn't reach 17 fantasy points. Wentz is a solid streamer this week. Staying on the streaming tip, managers in deep leagues should consider ï»¿Mo Alie-Coxï»¿. Wentz has never been afraid to target his tight ends. Over the past two weeks, Alie-Cox has boasted a 13.6% target share. More than both ï»¿Jonathan Taylorï»¿ and pass-catching specialist ï»¿Nyheim Hinesï»¿. No defense has allowed more fantasy points per game to tight ends. While we're talking here, let's give a shout out to the Colts DST. They're a top 10 defense that has been solid all year. Yes, they had their worst performance of the season on Monday against the Ravens. That happens when you're facing ï»¿Lamar Jacksonï»¿. Good news! ï»¿Davis Millsï»¿ is decidedly not Lamar Jackson. Last week's surprising performance against the Patriots feels like a mirage. We're still taking our shots against the Houston defense until we're proven wrong again. It doesn't look like ï»¿Zach Ertzï»¿ is going anywhere. Months of trade rumors have quieted, and Ertz has resumed his usually role in Philly's offense. That role could get bigger this week with ï»¿Dallas Goedertï»¿ on the reserve/COVID-19 list and not expected to play on Thursday night. We've preached starting your pass-catchers against a Buccaneers defense that has allowed the most passing yards and third-most passing touchdowns this season. Lots of fantasy managers gave up on ï»¿Myles Gaskinï»¿ after a poor start to the season. Many of those same managers might want to consider getting back on board -- at least for this week. A contest against the Jaguars is too good to pass up. Jacksonville has the NFL's 20th-ranked run defense while giving up nine rushing scores -- tied for the most in the league. Gaskin's target share might not be the same if ï»¿Tua Tagovailoaï»¿ returns in Week 6 but if his usage mirrors what Miami did last week, opportunities should be plentiful. It's gotten harder to make a case for ï»¿Evan Engramï»¿. Alas, for this week, I shall try. He's had a nearly 15% target share in the past three weeks. He's also had a 68% catch rate, which would be the second highest of his career if he can sustain it. Yet the biggest thing working in Engram's favor is the number of injuries the Giants are dealing with. We'll wait to see what happens with ï»¿Sterling Shepardï»¿, ï»¿Darius Slaytonï»¿ and ï»¿Kenny Golladayï»¿ this week, but if any of them are missing, Engram should have a solid target share once again. No one has talked about the Steelers passing game this year except to say that it's been bad. But this week offers hope for ï»¿Ben Roethlisbergerï»¿. The Seahawks defense has been an eyesore again this year, surrendering the third-most passing yards through the first five weeks. Pittsburgh's passing game has looked like a series of extended handoffs for much of the year. This is an opportunity for Big Ben to try pushing the ball downfield. If it doesn't work out this week, we can likely forget about Roethlisberger for the remainder of the year. This is also a chance to double down on ï»¿Pat Freiermuthï»¿. He was listed in this space a couple of weeks ago. It ended poorly. But the matchup is in his favor. Never let it be said we give up easily.

2021 at 03:40 PM", "body": "NFL Fantasy Analyst Editor's note: Giants coach Joe Judge told reporters Monday that Toney underwent an X-ray on a lower leg injury he suffered during Sunday's game. Judge said that he does not believe Toney's injury is \"anything significant\" nor \"something season-ending\" but his status for Week 6 appears to be in question, per the New York Post. Kadarius ToneyÂ had his Week 5 end early after he was ejected for throwing a punch, but he made the most of the time he was out there before his inauspicious end. Toney was targetedÂ 13 times, catching 10 of them for 189 yards Sunday against the Cowboys. He also carried the ball once for seven yards.Â He exploded forÂ 29.6 fantasy points, enough to make him a WR1 in Week 5.Â Toney was brought along slowly, having just five targets in the first three weeks combined, but he wasÂ called upon with ï»¿Sterling Shepardï»¿ and ï»¿Darius Slaytonï»¿ out. Last week Toney saw nine targets, catching six of them for 78 yards.Â Not only have Shepard and Slayton missed the last two, but ï»¿Kenny Golladayï»¿ exited Week 5 with a knee injury.Â The Giants are thin at receiver, plus, they invested aÂ first-roundÂ pick into Toney. With Toney playing this well the last two weeks, they will not look to go away from him.Â The reports on Toney out of college were that he was a raw route runner, but an eliteÂ option with the ball in his hands. Toney has done a good job getting open and deserves credit, but the Giants also deserve credit for running plays that fit his strengths.Â Toney is seeing huge volume with the Giants banged up at receiver, andÂ Toney is so explosive that it leads to him having a high weekly ceiling. Toney is the top waiver option of the week due to that upside he brings. Here is what I wrote about himÂ heading into the NFL Draft:Â Â  \"He had a career season in 2020, posting 984 yards and 10 TDs on 70 catches. In his first three seasons combined, he posted 50 catches, 606 yards and two TDs. He is also utilized in the running game, rushing for 580 yards in his college career. His 477 yards after the catch in 2020 ranked eighth among all draft-eligible players.Â He picked up 27 explosive plays (15+ yards) and forced 20 missed tackles, both of which ranked in the top-five in this class.\"Â  Week 6 is the first week with byes! The Falcons, Jets,Â SaintsÂ and 49ers will all be on bye in Week 6, so make plans to replace any of those players on your roster!Â Â  Check if available:Emmanuel Sanders,Â Trevor Lawrence, Michael Carter, Trey Lance, Justin Fields,Â RashodÂ Bateman.Â  You can drop: ï»¿Robby Andersonï»¿, Trey Sermon, Devin Singletary, Cole Beasley, RobertÂ Tonyan, Curtis Samuel.Â  Do not drop:Â ï»¿Calvin Ridleyï»¿, ï»¿Stefon Diggsï»¿,Â A.J. Brown, Odell Beckham Jr., Allen Robinson, ï»¿Clyde Edwards-Helaireï»¿.Â  I have written about Lance and FieldsÂ a number ofÂ times this season, but if either is out there in your league, they are still strong stash options.Â Â  Saints QB Jameis Winstonthrew for a season-high 279 pass yards with four TDs againstÂ Washington. It was his second game of the season with four or more touchdown passes and his third multi-TD game of the season. Winston hasÂ been up and down this season, topping 25 fantasy points twice and being belowÂ 15 fantasy points in the other three. But this game was a step in the right direction as he looked comfortable and was able to bring back the dep ball.Â He will be on bye in Week 6, meaning he will be even easier to grab off the waiver wire if youÂ are in need ofÂ a QB.Â Â  Falcons QB Matt Ryanplayed well across the pond, throwing for 342 yards and two scores.Â To make it more impressive, he did it against a Jets defense that had been very stingy to QBs, without Ridley orÂ ï»¿Russell Gageï»¿. Just a week ago, Ryan threw forÂ 283 yards and four touchdowns. He has thrown for multiple passing touchdowns in four straight games. Ryan will be up and down, but it has been more upÂ than down lately. He is on bye in Week 6, so you won't have much competition trying to grab him off the waiver wire. Seahawks QB Geno Smithcame in in relief of Russell Wilson and looked amazing. He threw for 131 yards and a touchdown and nearly led a comeback but threw an interception on a play where ï»¿Tyler Lockettï»¿ tripped.Â Smith also rushed three times for 23 yards.Â Wilson is expected to miss a few weeks, and NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported the Seahawks QB is targeting a Week 10 return. That means Smith is in play the next few weeks.Â He will have good pass catchers around him and can add some points with his legs. He is best suited in two-QB formats such asÂ superflex, as you can find a better option in a one QB league.Â Â  Chiefs RB Darrel Williamswas a late addition to the waiver wire list as Edwards-Helaire suffered an MCL sprain Sunday vs. the Bills. But Williams was the lead back for the rest of the way for the Chiefs. He finished the week playing 41 percent of the snaps, carrying the ball five times for 27Â yardsÂ and seeing five targets, catching three for 18 yards. Williams will be the lead back on one of the best offenses in football for as long as CEH needs to recover. That is a favorable spot to be in, andÂ it makes him anÂ RB you want to have on your roster. He will be an RB2, with RB1 upside in this offense. Be aggressive and spend up to get him on the waiver wire. This is also a lesson that isÂ isÂ advantageous to roster backs like this in fantasy -- those good backups who will be a lead back and not in a committee on a good offense. We have seen too many of these backs become high-priced waiver wire options. It's time to preemptively roster these backs instead of purely depth receivers.Â Â  Bears RB Khalil Herbertwas used way more than expected in the Bears first game without ï»¿David Montgomeryï»¿.Â He played 52 percent of the snaps, to Damien Williams' 50 percent. Herbert also out carried Williams, 18 to 16. Herbert rushed for 75 yards in the game.Â Herbert had one touch inside theÂ 10-yard line, while Williams had three. Williams is the top option here still, as he had the valuable touches near the goal line and in the passing game, but Herbert is clearly a big part of theÂ Bears' running game while Montgomery is sidelined.Â He may not have had a huge fantasy day, but he had enough volume in this game to warrant beingÂ a flex option in favorable matchups. Also, if anything was to happen to Williams, who has already been banged up this season, he would see a huge weekly workload.Â Â  Packers RB A.J. DillonÂ had his best game of the season in Week 5 scoring 17.9 fantasy points. He rushed eight times for 30 yards, but it was his pass game usage that really makes him intriguing. He was targeted four times, catching all four for 49 yards and a touchdown. Dillon now has 28 touches in the past two weeks after seeing 15 carries and one catch in Week 4. He has topped double-digit fantasy points in each of those games. Dillon has been playing a third of the snaps each week, but he has been seeing enough usage on those snaps to warrant being a flex option. You also cannot overlook that he is next in line for a large workload on a great offense should anything happen to Aaron Jones. It's never fun to think about injuries, but almost every week the topÂ pickupÂ is a running back after the starter was injured. You want to roster the backups that are clearly the next man up. Dillon is still available in around 60 percent of NFL.com leagues, that needs to change.Â Â  Giants RB Devontae Bookerwas called into action after Saquon BarkleyÂ stepped on a defender's foot and sprained his ankle. Barkley is expected to miss this Sunday's game and is considered week-to-week, per Rapoport. If Barkley misses extended time, Booker is the next man up in New York. In Week 5, he playedÂ 89 percent of the snaps,Â had 16 carries and fourÂ targets. That is workhorse volume. He turned it into 58 yards and a touchdown, with three catches.Â That sort of volume is enough to make him an RB2 or at the worst a flex option each week.Â Â  Patriots RB RhamondreÂ Stevensonplayed 34 percent of the snapsÂ with 11 carriesÂ after Damien Harris left the game due to aÂ chest injury. Harris exited, then returned, then left the game for good in the fourth quarter. His Week 6 status needs to be monitored, butÂ if he misses time Stevenson would be the lead runner against the Cowboys. Stevenson is a massive back who has surprising speed. He was a preseason darling whoÂ would be an RB3/flex option if Harris misses time. Seahawks RB Alex Collins  was forced to start in Week 5 as Chris Carson was out with a neck injury. Collins played 72 percent of the snaps and had 15 carries and three targets. He finished with 72 yards and just under 10 fantasy points. He is clearly the lead back here if Carson misses another week. The volume seems safe and Week 5 feels like his floor. He does not come with the highest ceiling, but he should be rostered given how much time Carson has missed in his career. Rams RB Sony Michel  carried the ball 11 times for 37 yards and a touchdown on Thursday Night Football. He caught his only target for eight yards. He was used wen Darrell Henderson gave us a scare and was getting checked out on the sideline. Henderson has already missed time this season and Michel was a useful fantasy piece. His weekly usage with Henderson in there has to be monitored, but Henderson is not the face of durability and if he misses time Michel becomes the lead back on one of the best offenses in the NFL. He is worth stashing. Buccaneers RB Giovani Bernard  found the end zone again in Week 5. He didn't see huge volume, however, playing 22 percent of the snaps with just four carries and two targets. That was largely because it was a blow out, but when he was last healthy in Week 3, he was heavily used and scored over 20 fantasy points. He is the Bucs' top pass-catching RB option. Patriots RB Brandon Bolden  is the new James White. He was targeted four times in Week 5. He did not have a big fantasy day, but he has now been targeted between four and six times in each of the past three games. His usage will increase in games where the Patriots are trailing. Jaguars RB Carlos Hyde  was used in the biggest play of the game for the Jaguars. It was a fourth-and-goal carry from the 1-yard line as they attempted to cut it to a one-score game in the fourth quarter. Hyde was stuffed, but he had two carries inside the 10. His usage near the goal line is new, as all the previous touches inside the 10 had gone to James Robinson. Hyde isn't used enough to start, but if anything was to happen to Robinson he would see 20-plus touches a week and be a top waiver wire add. Those are the types of backs you stash if you have the spot. Deeper options: Texans RB David Johnson was targeted six times, catching five of them for 46 yards. He only carried the ball twice for five yards. Johnson has to share the backfield with ï»¿Mark Ingramï»¿ and ï»¿Phillip Lindsayï»¿, but he has the passing down duties on lock. He is purely a deep league option, but there is value in being the pass-catching back on a team that will trail a lot. Jets RB Ty Johnson played 39 percent of the snaps, carrying the ball four times and seeing three targets. He went for 34 yards and scored a touchdown against the Falcons in London. He is only on the radar in deeper leagues, but he is the Jets' RB2 and sees consistent work each week. Cardinals WR Rondale Moore  is no stranger to the waiver wire article. He played 48 percent of the snaps in Week 5 and had six targets, catching five for 59 yards -- including one of the prettiest sideline catches you will see. Moore nearly had a touchdown, but he was ruled out at the one. He was being used in the red zone, however, and that is encouraging. He also added three carries for 38 yards running the option with ï»¿Kyler Murrayï»¿, in total going for 14.7 fantasy points. He had a down two weeks coming into Week 5 and was thrown back on a lot of waivers, but that is now double-digit fantasy points in three of five games this season. He will be up and down, but he is an explosive option who just needs to see some consistent volume. He has a chance of surpassing A.J. Green in the pecking order as the season goes on. Lions WR Amon-Ra St. Brown  saw eight targets for a second straight week, leading the Lions in targets in each of those games. He caught seven of them for 65 yards, giving him 13 fantasy points for a second straight game. St. Brown started slow but has seen a lot of volume as of late and it should continue, as Quintez Cephus suffered a shoulder injury in Week 5 and likely will miss the remainder of the season. St. Brown doesn't have the highest ceiling, but he is a big-bodied slot receiver who could play the part of Detroit ï»¿Cooper Kuppï»¿ for ï»¿Jared Goffï»¿. The volume alone makes St. Brown worthy of taking a flier on. Broncos WR Tim Patrick  continues to play the WR2 role until ï»¿Jerry Jeudyï»¿ returns. He saw nine targets in Week 5, catching seven of them for 89 yards. Patrick's targets have now increased in three straight games, and he has topped 12 fantasy points in four of five games. His 15.9 fantasy points this week is his season high, so his ceiling isn't that high, but he has a consistent floor. Raiders WR Hunter Renfrow  had eight targets in Week 5, tied with ï»¿Darren Wallerï»¿ for the most on the team. He led the Raiders with both six catches and 56 yards. He now has eight targets in two straight games. He also has at least five catches in every game and has over 50 yards in all but one. Renfrow has scored double-digit fantasy points in ever game this season and twice has topped 16. He doesn't bring a high ceiling but he brings a safe floor that could come in handy when the bye weeks hit. Deeper options: Dolphins WR Preston Williams was targeted five times, catching three for 60 yards. Only Myles Gaskin had more yards. Williams was used more with Will Fuller on injured reserve and DeVante Parker out. His value is tied to Parker playing, but if Parker sits again, you can stream Williams. Saints WRs Marquez Callaway and Deonte Harris both hit in Week 5. Callaway had four catches for 85 yards and two scores on eight targets, while Harris caught his only target for 72 yards and a touchdown. Both have been boom-or-bust options, but they have high upside and are a risk worth taking in deeper leagues. Patriots TE Hunter Henry  led the Patriots in all receiving categories in Week 5. He finished with eight targets, six catches, 75 yards and a touchdown while playing 62 percent of the snaps. He had a 29 percent target share, the highest he has had in a game this season. His fantasy points have increased in every game this season, and he has topped 13 fantasy points in his last two games. We are always looking for tight ends and Henry is starting to look like one you can trust. Giants TE Evan Engram  caught all four of his targets for 55 yards against the Cowboys in Week 5. It was the fewest targets he has had all year, but the most fantasy points. Engram though may get an uptick in volume as the Giants remain thin when it comes to pass catchers. Shepard and Slayton have missed two straight, while Golladay and Barkley left with injuries last week. That makes Engram a streamable option for those in need of a tight end. Browns TE David Njoku  caught all of his team-high seven targets for 149 yards and a touchdown. The bulk came on his 71-yard touchdown catch, but that sort of volume is tough to ignore. This was in a game ï»¿Austin Hooperï»¿ played but was not targeted. Njoku played 66 percent of the snaps and looked like a dangerous weapon for the Browns. He has flashed before, so we know his potential, now all we need to see is some consistency. Jaguars TE Dan Arnold  was targeted eight times in Week 5, tied for the most on the Jags. He caught six of them for a team-high 64 receiving yards. The Jags traded for Arnold prior to Week 4, when they had a short week with a Thursday night game. They clearly used the extended time getting Arnold more involved in the game plan. He led Jags tight ends playing 74 percent of the snaps. Sorry Tim Tebow, Arnold is the Jags tight end who is fantasy relevant. He is more in play in deeper leagues, but his usage is definitely something to keep an eye on. Deeper options: Chargers TE Donald Parham  got to play 53 percent of the snaps and caught both his targets for 29 yards and a touchdown. He also caught a two-point conversion. He has now scored over nine fantasy points in two straight games. He still has to battle for playing time and targets with Jared Cook, but Parham is a big, athletic tight end who has some upside. He is worthy of a flier in deeper leagues. Falcons TE Hayden Hurst  is more of a deep league option and will be on bye next week, but with the Falcons thin in Week 5 he was targeted five times, catching four for 40 yards and a score. Two tight end sets is a staple of an Arthur Smith offense and if Atlanta continues to struggle getting production from their receivers, Hurst could be more utilized even after the Falcons get healthy.
